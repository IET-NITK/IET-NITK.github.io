# Audio to Sign Language Translator


Sign languages are visual languages that use hand, facial and body movements as a means of communication. There are over 135 different sign languages all around the world including American Sign Language (ASL), Indian Sign Language (ISL) and British Sign Language (BSL). Sign languages are an extremely important communication tool for many deaf and hard-of-hearing people.  Sign languages are the native languages of the Deaf community and provide full access to communication. Although sign languages are used primarily by people who are deaf, they are also used by others, such as people who can hear but canâ€™t speak. Conversion of audio to ISL helps the common folks to interact with people with such disabilities without the language barrier, enriching both of their lives.

## Methodology
- Audio input on the platform using Python Speech Recognition module.
- Conversion of audio to text using Google Speech API.
- Dependency parser for analysing grammatical structure of the sentence and establishing relationship between words.
- ISL Generator: ISL of input sentence using ISL grammar rules.
- Generation of Sign language with concatenating videos
