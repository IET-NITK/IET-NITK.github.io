# Handwritten Equation Solver


## AIM of the Project
As the name of the project suggests, we intend to make such a system(Web Interface) in which user will just upload his/her handwritten equation(s) and in return would get the solution to that.
> Note: The project is restricted only for Polynomials & Linear Equations(1 & 2 Variable)

## Implementation
- For detecting handwritten equation, we need to detect number,mathematical symbols,variables etc. So firstly, we trained a CNN(Convolutional Nueral Network) Model over a specified dataset.
- Now once the CNN Model was tested enough for detecting handwritten contents, we further proceed to apply some Algebra to solve these detected Equations/Polynomials.
- Then, we created a Frontend where user can upload & crop the images of the handwritten equation and can feed it further to the Backend Servers.
- The user uploaded images are way to diffrent from the images that CNN demands,Hence we applied Image processing(OpenCV) on the user uploaded image to convert it into a desired image.

## Frameworks & Modules Used
- **Tensorflow** & **Keras** (for Training & Testing CNN Model)
- **Flask** Web Framework (for Backend)
- **HTML**,**CSS**,**JS**,**Bootstrap**(for Frontend)
- **OpenCV** Library of Python (for Image Processing)
- **sympy** module(Handles all equation Solving)

## Working of the Project
> Note: For the project 'a','b' are variables & 'x' is the multiplication sign.Also '=0' is already understood by the model so user need not write it. So if the Equation is 15a=45, then user need to write 15a-45 and then upload it on the website.
- The user uploads an image to the website as shown below:-

- Then the image is processed and converted to desired image that model wants as shown below.

- Model then detect that an equation with **variable 'a'** has been uploaded & generates the following output.

- Similarly for **Linear Equation in two variable** user need to upload two Images as shown below:-

- Again Model coverts both images as desired images & Solves it!!

- **Model produces Following output:-**

## Why CNN?
- In traditional Neural Networks, one need to specify the important features to be considered while **CNN** automatically detects the important features without any **Human Supervision.**
- Our project involved **high level pixel processing** and CNN's are considered to be the best for that as it can learn the key features for any class itself.
- **CNN's** even have better accuracy than any other **Machine Learning Model** when it comes to **"Detection"**.Hence CNN was the best thing to be used for this project.

## Challenges We ran into
- When we trained the CNN Model for **"="** , **"("** & **")"** signs, its accuracy reduced significantly which is absurd.
- Introducing variable **"x"** was challenging as **"x"** also represents multiplication sign. So we introduced **"a"** & **"b"** as variables.
- User is constrained to write the equation in a paper with white unruled background. Ruled background confuses the CNN Model & it produces unusual results.

## Steps to Test Backend
- Download the **.ipynb** file from the github & upload it in **Google Colab**.
- Also Do upload the **model** folder in the colab environment.
- Now you may upload your own custom equations in the Colab environment & all other steps are mentioned in the .ipynb file itself.
> Do Ensure that you crop the equation to the maximum extent.
