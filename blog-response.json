      "blog_body": "# Insane Engineering Of Sr71\r\n\r\n##### *BY  ROHIT BEHERA - JULY 13TH, 2022*\r\n\r\nIt’s hard to explain the engineering marvel that is the SR-71 Blackbird. A long-range plane capable of flying 26 kilometers above the surface of the planet. So high that the pilots could see the curvature on the planet and the inky black of space from their cockpits. It flew so fast that the engineers had to develop entirely new materials and designs to mitigate and dissipate the heat generated from aerodynamic friction. Unique engines were needed to function from 0 up to Mach 3.2, dealing with a myriad of problems like cooling, fuel efficiency, and supersonic shock waves interfering with airflow. A plane so advanced that when it detected a surface-to-air missile its response was simply to change course and speed up. Even though the missiles had a higher top speed, they couldn’t achieve the range and high altitude maneuverability the Blackbird could. A speed at which the SR-71 could cruise for extended periods.\r\n\r\n![aerodynamics](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/2.max-800x600.jpg)\r\n\r\nHow on earth did it manage that? To achieve those kinds of speeds a ramjet is typically needed. A ramjet, as you can probably guess from the name, relies on ram pressure to operate. Ram Pressure is simply the pressure that occurs as a plane rams itself through the air. So, as the engine moves through the sky, it funnels this high-pressure air inside. Before entering the combustion chamber the supersonic airflow must first be slowed down. This acts as the compressor stage of a normal jet engine, elevating the air pressure before it enters the combustion chamber. Once the air enters the combustion chamber, It is mixed with fuel and ignited. It expands and accelerates once again out of the exit nozzle. With no moving parts, this type of engine is capable of flying at speeds far greater than a typical turbine-driven engine, but it cannot start from zero. It needs forward movement to achieve the correct compression of air in the combustion chamber. So, they are either dropped from a conventional plane, have a secondary propulsion system, or are a hybrid of a conventional jet engine and a ramjet, which is precisely what the SR-71 used.\r\n\r\nThe turbojet J58 engine of the SR-71 is nestled inside the nacelle here. In front and around The J58 is a complicated system of airflow management. These control mechanisms allow the propulsion system to transition from a primarily turbojet engine to a ramjet engine in mid-flight\r\n\r\nFirst, the inlet spike. It is capable of moving forward and back by 0.66 meters. This adjusts the inlet and the throat area, which controls the airflow entering the engine. It also keeps the position of the normal shock wave at its ideal position between the inlet throat and the compressor, this is the most efficient position for the shock wave, as it minimizes the energy lost due to drag as air flows over the shock wave. The inlet spike stays in the forward position until Mach 1.6. After this point, it begins to move backward by 41 millimeters forever 0.1 increase in Mach number. Keeping the shock wave in its ideal position. The inlet spike contains perforations that connect to the outside of the nacelle through ducts. Initially, the flow of air will come from the outside in to provide additional airflow to the turbojet engines, but once the plane hits about Mach 0.5 this airflow reverses. As the plane speeds up the inlet spike develops a significant boundary layer of air. A boundary layer is a layer of very slow-moving air that clings to the surface of objects. By bleeding this layer of slow-moving air off to the inlet spike it frees up a greater area of the inlet area for high energy fast-moving air, and thus improves efficiency. Around the engine, there is a bypass area, which takes air from the inlet and bypasses it is around the J58 engine. This air was used to cool the J58, which again improved engine efficiency and allowed the plane to fly faster. After the air passes the engine it rejoins the airflow just after the engine afterburner, adding additional thrust as more oxygen becomes available for combustion and increases the pressure through the ejector nozzle. Air got into this bypass area in several ways. There was a shock trap, otherwise known as the cowl bleed, located here, which again helped minimize boundary layer growth. There were stuck-in doors, located here, which opened only from Mach 0 to Mach 0.5, to add additional air to the bypass for engine cooling.\r\n\r\n![aerodynamics](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/3.max-800x600.jpg)\r\n\r\nAir from the aft bypass doors, located just before the J58 inlet, also fed into the bypass. These together with the forward bypass doors, which vented to the atmosphere were used to control the pressure level in the inlet at the optimum level. If it was getting too high a pressure sensor would trigger the forward bypass doors to open allowing more air to exit the inlet, while the aft bypass doors were controlled by the pilot. These doors played a critical role in maintaining the position of the normal shock wave. If this was mismanaged the engine would lose control of the normal shock wave and may even spit it out of the intake. Resulting in sudden power loss, called an unstart, which would cause the plane to violently yaw in the direction of the faulty engine. If this happened the forward bypass doors would open fully and the spike would move forward to reduce back-pressure and get the shock-wave back to its normal position. Besides this bypass area that took the air from the inlet and dumped it into the ejector, 6 bypass ducts took the air from the compressor and dumped it directly into the afterburner. These ducts were the primary mechanism that transformed the engine from a turbojet into a ramjet.\r\n\r\nAfterburners are great, they significantly add to thrust without needing a whole lot of additional weight. They just inject fuel into the exhaust of a jet engine and ignite it with whatever oxygen is left to provide additional expansion and therefore thrust, but they are inefficient. However, as the speed increases, they are the only feasible way to generate thrust, and they do gain efficiency thanks to the forward motion providing the compression of air needed to run them, instead of the turbine needing to be powered to turn the compressor stage. The crazy thing about the SR-71 however, is that the engineers could have eked out more thrust from this engine to increase the top speed even more. Ramjets can go up to Mach 5.\r\n\r\nSo why did they stop at 3.2 mach? Would they have run out of fuel? Fuel efficiency in terms of cost doesn’t mean a whole lot to a military plane like this. The military doesn’t care about cost. But, the more fuel you carry the heavier and bigger the plane gets, increasing the fuel it uses. There is a break-even point and the range of the plane will be limited, but the engineers did manage to fill the plane up with an astounding amount of fuel with some clever engineering. The SR-71 used something called a total wet wing fuel tank system, which meant that the fuel was not contained within a separate fuel bladder. This was a weight-saving measure, separate metal fuel tanks would add too much weight and lighter plastic ones would melt from the intense heat generated from the aerodynamic friction. So, the fuel was contained by the skin of the plane itself. The engineers applied sealant to every gap the fuel could come out of, but because the titanium skin of the plane expanded and contracted with every flight gradually deteriorated over time. Allowing fuel to leak out. Because of this, the SR-71 had to regularly go into maintenance and have sealant reapplied, But it usually just came back still leaking, just not quite as much. The number of manhours required to reduce it to zero was simply too great to fit between flights, so they just had an allowable fuel leak limit.\r\n\r\n![aerodynamics](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/4.max-800x600.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis plane, like a rocket, was mostly fuel. Its dry weight, depending on the sensor. The paid load was between 25 tons and 27 tons. Its wet weight was 61 to 63 tons. Making It weighs 59% fuel to feed those hungry engines. Even then, without the ability to refuel in the air this plane would have had a terrible the range for what was supposed to be a long-range spy plane. The range varied greatly. For example, the engines became significantly less efficient when the outside temperatures were higher. A fully loaded SR-71 could expect to burn nearly 13 metric tons of fuel accelerating from Mach 1.25 at 30,000 feet to Mach 3.0 at 70,000 feet if the outside temperature was 10 degrees celsius above standard. That’s 36% of its fuel capacity. If it was 10 degrees below standard, the fuel burn nearly halved to 7.2 tons. And of course, the range was severely affected by their speed and use of the afterburner, but on average the SR-71 had a range of about 5,200 kilometers. The longest operational sortie occurred in 1987 when the US flew the SR-71 from Okinawa to observe developments in the Iran-Iraq war. This mission lasted 11.2 hours and likely required at least 5 aerial refuelings along the way. So, if it wasn’t the fuel or engines that limited the SR-71s top speed. What did?\r\n\r\nAt Mach 3.2 the nose of the SR-71 reached 300 degrees celsius, while the engine nacelles could reach 306 at the front and 649 at the back. This is what truly limited the top speed of the SR-71. Without careful material selection and design, the plane would simply overheat and fail. Even the fuel needed to be specially formulated to get around these overheating issues. It was a specially formulated fuel called JP7. Which had very low volatility with a high flash point. This was needed partially because the fuel leaked on the runway and they needed a fuel that wouldn’t ignite easily or evaporate and make the ground crew ill, but mostly they needed a fuel that wouldn’t vaporize in the tanks and cause fuel feed and pressurization problems. The JP7 fuel was so stable that it doubled as a coolant for the entire plane. The fuel was pumped around the airframe to cool critical components like the engine oil, hydraulic systems, and control electronics. When the fuel got too hot it was simply sent to the engines for combustion. The fuel was so stable that the plane needed to carry Triethylborane, a fuel that spontaneously ignites in the presence of oxygen, to start the combustion cycle and afterburners. The plane usually only carried about 16 shots of this, so the pilots needed to manage them carefully, particularly when slowing down for refueling or managing unstarts. One huge question I had about the SR-71 was why it was painted black. Airliners are all white to reflect heat and prevent the plane from overheating. If that applies to an airliner, Why not the SR-71?\r\n\r\nThe SR-71s predecessors were unpainted, which saved weight, and the areas exposed to the highest temperatures were painted black. Why was this? Surely black would absorb more heat? The Concorde was once painted blue for a Pepsi ad campaign and had to lower its speed, as it absorbed too much heat from the sun. However, the Concorde did not fly nearly as high or as fast as the SR-71, and as the SR-71 rose the energy is absorbed from the sun dwindled in comparison to the heat it gained from aerodynamic friction. For this, we have to refer to something called Kirchoff’s Rule of Radiation, which tells us that a good heat absorber, like a black object, is also an equally effective heat emitter. So, the black paint helped the SR-71 radiate heat away from the plane, as it allowed the plane to radiate more heat than it gained from radiation from the sun. These efforts helped keep the plane cool, but the structure of the plane still needed to incredibly heat stable. Aluminum is typically the material aircraft engineers turn to. It was used for the Concorde, but as we saw it too had its speed limited by heat to a much lower Mach 2. Aluminum is cheap, has a great strength-to-weight ratio, and is easily machinable.\r\n\r\nTitanium, the material that made up 93% of the SR-71, has only one of these properties, Its strength-to-weight ratio, otherwise known as a specific strength, is fantastic. But, Titanium is incredibly expensive, despite it being the 7th most common metal in Earth’s crust. The refinement process is incredibly long and requires expensive consumables. It’s also not easily machinable as it readily reacts with air when welding or forging, becoming brittle. For these reasons, titanium is rarely used in structural parts in aviation. However, The real benefit of titanium is its ability to resist heat. The reasons for this are complex that we will explore in-depth in the future. However, the gist is that titanium alloys have incredibly strong bonding within their crystal lattice that resist heat from breaking them apart. Titanium alloys can resist temperatures up to 600 degrees Celcius before their atoms begin to diffuse and slide over each other significantly. Allowing it to retain much of its strength even at 300 degrees. It also has a very low thermal expansion, so that expansion and contraction we mentioned earlier are minimized. Reducing the thermal stresses in the aircraft. But Titanium too has its limits, and for the SR-71 this was about 3.2 Mach.\r\n\r\nToday engineers have made huge strides in material science. The SR-71 used heat-resistant composite materials as radar-absorbing wedges between the structural frame, located in these locations. The manufacturing techniques needed to make composite materials as load-bearing structures did not yet exist, but that has changed. The SR-71s successor the SR-72, which is now in development, will take advantage of new high-performance composites, which will allow it to reach speeds up to Mach 6. Many of its engine components will likely be 3D printed titanium with cooling ducts printed right into the part. Its range also won’t be determined by pilots, as it will be an autonomous drone.\r\n\r\n##### *WRITTEN BY  ROHIT BEHERA - JULY 13TH, 2022*",

      "title": "The Future Of Processors And Computing",
      "blog_body": "The CPU has had a revolutionary phase backed up with many challenges to become what it looks like today. During the initial 2000s, when the fight for performance was at its peak, AMD and Intel were contending as the frontrunners. At first, increasing clock speed posed a major threat which lasted for quite a while and didn't require much effort. However, due to the laws of physics, this rapid growth had to reach its end.\r\n\r\nAccording to Moore's Law, the number of transistors on a chip had to be doubled every 24 months. Processors had to become smaller to accommodate more transistors, which would mean better performance. However, the resultant increase in temperature would depend on massive cooling. Therefore, the race for speed soon changed its trajectory to be the fight against the laws of physics. Though, the solution to this problem didn't take much of a cost. Instead of increasing clock speeds, producers now introduce multiple-core chips, where each core had the exact same clock speed because of which computers could now be more effective in performing multiple tasks during the same intervals.\r\n\r\n![SPACE](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/1.max-800x600_Mr08U9t.png)\r\n\r\nThe strategy ultimately prevailed but it came along with some drawbacks. The introduction of multiple cores needed developers to introduce different algorithms so that the improvements could be observable. Now, this didn't come quite easy in the gaming world where the CPU's performance had always been a prime characteristic. Another issue was that the more cores you have, operating them becomes harder.\r\n\r\nIt was also difficult to come up with an efficient code that would function with all the cores. If there was a possibility to develop a 150 GHz single- core unit, it would've been the ideal machine. However, silicon chips cannot be clocked up that fast due to the laws of physics. And this started to raise possibilities of replacing silicon in the processor industry.\r\n\r\n![SPACE](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/2.max-800x600.png)\r\n\r\nTheoretically, the smallest size that is achievable is the width of a silicon atom (0.2 nm) and right now we are achieving around a 3 nm design. Inevitably, the progression of making chips smaller will come to an end. Hence, chip makers are constantly on the run trying to find out how to dodge this ultimate limitation with different kinds of gate setups, which also leads to alternative options which may replace silicon.\r\n\r\nOptical Computing is often looked at as potential reliability in the future. Now to make these computers function on light, we need optical transistors. But there's a major obstacle when it comes to light, i.e., light has a relatively large wavelength nowhere even close to the nanometer threshold attained by silicon. Then there are these weird particles known as surface plasmon that can be excited on the surface of materials. So, they can travel like a photon, and hence they are faster than a typical silicon computer. But more importantly, it's more coherent than a silicon complement.\r\n\r\nUltimate light computers can be up to 5,000 times faster than conventional computers, and for processors that would mean that it's running into the terahertz clock rate which is simply mind-boggling. Even though there are some companies out there that are using light technology, we are still quite a way away from making a plasmon light computer.\r\n\r\n![SPACE](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/3.max-800x600.png)\r\n\r\nThere has been a lot of talk about the potential of quantum computers. As the ability to represent a superposition quantum state is immense, they can work millions of computations at once. Another reason why they're so fast is that each qubit (quantum bit), which is added to the machine exponentially grows the calculative ability of the computer. But they do face a few challenges. For instance, they need to be cryogenically cooled to a level near absolute zero which is of extreme cold. Anything around that, and you lose the property of the qubit. Another dispute is that quantum computers solve problems and that is, there are no big data machines they can only deal with specific problems. Hence, they cannot become a replacement for conventional computing.\r\n\r\nSo, they may be good at predicting the stock market or even cracking code because of their ability to simultaneously calculate these things. But when it comes to booting Windows or even playing a simple videogame, they're not that practical and a classical algorithm will probably win in a sheer speed linear calculation. So ultimately quantum computers will have a place in certain applications, but they will not replace your conventional desktop computer anytime soon.\r\n\r\n![SPACE](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/1_A3TJEpR.max-800x600.png)\r\n\r\nSilicon will eventually slow down in progression, and there could be a huge investment in these types of alternative materials. Ultimately, we would not see any short-term replacement for silicon, as the infrastructure for product distribution, and sale of silicon chips have already been set up, running for decades. Replacing all that stuff would require years, not to mention billions of dollars in investment. Nevertheless, it's only a matter of time before we will see the stop of progressio in silicon technology. It's not a matter of if, it's just when.\r\n\r\n##### *WRITTEN BY  REHAN NASAR - JULY 24TH, 2022*",

      "blog_body": "# Ai For Cybersecurity\r\n\r\n\r\nCybercrime is becoming more common as technology advances, and it is also becoming more complex. Since the enterprise attack surface is so large, there are hundreds of billions of time-varying signals that must be accurately analysed to determine danger. Analyzing these billions of signals is not a human scale problem anymore.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based cybersecurity technologies have emerged to assist information security teams in reducing breach risk and improving their security posture quickly and effectively. AI and machine learning (ML) have become key technologies in information security because they can easily examine millions of events and recognise a wide range of threats, such as detecting risky activity that could lead to a phishing attack or malicious code download.\r\n\r\n# Implementation of AI for cybersecurity\r\nAI has influenced security by assisting professionals in detecting network anomalies by observing user behaviour and analyzing patterns. Security professionals may also use artificial intelligence to analyse network data and identify vulnerabilities in order to prevent malicious attacks.\r\n\r\n### **1)Using biometric logins**\r\n\r\nPasswords are vulnerable to cyber attacks, according to several cybersecurity experts.Hence users' personal details, credit card information, and other sensitive information can be easily stolen. As a result of deploying AI for cybersecurity, biometric login strategies for safe logins have been implemented. AI systems will accurately scan fingerprints, retinas, and palm prints. Biometric logins can be used in combination with current passwords on devices such as smartphones for safe login.\r\n\r\n### **2)Detecting threats and malicious activities**\r\n\r\nAs new malware pieces are being created every month. Traditional cybersecurity systems are ineffective in dealing with new malware forms. As a result, implementing AI for cybersecurity is a viable solution to such issues.\r\n\r\nWith the help of many datasets that include algorithms and codes, cybersecurity firms are teaching AI systems to detect malware and viruses. AI can use this data to perform pattern recognition, which aids in the detection of malicious software actions. Furthermore, AI and machine learning have the potential to play a critical role in online security. Website path traversals can be analyzed using machine learning to see whether they lead to malicious domains. Similarly, AI-based systems can detect malicious files and prevent them from infecting the device.\r\n\r\n### **3)Securing conditional access**\r\n\r\nAuthentication models are often used by companies to protect sensitive information from unwanted people . If an employee or business leader with higher authentication privileges accesses such data remotely, the system can be hacked through the network. Traditional authentication models are less agile in these situations. Using AI for cybersecurity, on the other hand, would aid in the creation of a complex, real-time, and global authentication system that adjusts access privileges based on location or network.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **4)Breach Risk Prediction**\r\n\r\nAI-based systems will predict how and when you're most likely to be hacked, allowing you to allocate resources and tools to vulnerable areas. Prescriptive insights obtained from AI research will assist you in configuring and improving controls and processes to increase the organization's cyber resilience the most effectively.\r\n\r\n# Limitations of Using AI for cybersecurity\r\nWhile there are several advantages to using AI for cybersecurity, there are several drawbacks also-\r\n\r\n1. Black hat hackers may use AI to test their own malware in the same way as ethical hackers and cybersecurity experts do. Hackers can evolve advanced malware or even AI-proof malware strains with constant testing.\r\n2. For starters, creating and maintaining an AI-based system requires a significant amount of memory, processing power, and data.\r\n3. Training data must be correct, since incorrect data can result in inefficient outcomes. As a result, locating and gathering specific datasets can be a time-consuming and repetitive process.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\nAI has emerged as a necessary technology for augmenting the efforts of human information security teams in recent years. Since humans can no longer defend the complex enterprise attack surface effectively, AI offers much-needed analysis and threat detection that can be used by cybersecurity professionals to reduce breach risk and enhance protection posture. In the field of security, AI can identify and prioritise danger, detect malware on a network instantly, guide incident response, and control risks before they occur.\r\n\r\n##### *WRITTEN BY  SOMESH KARTIKEYA - JULY 30TH, 2022*",

      "blog_body": "> “Whenever the price of cryptocurrency is rallying, people start spending a lot more.” --- Erik Voorhees\r\n\r\n\r\nImagine a world where banks aren’t involved as third parties in transactions and a direct interaction between the sender and receiver is established, and the hassle of currency exchange is eliminated . ‘Cryptocurrency’ is a fairly popular terms familiar to most people. But not many know it’s applications and advantages over the conventional type of currencies which are more widely used in today’s world.\r\n\r\n# Introduction to cryptocurrency:\r\n\r\nThe concept of Cryptocurrency was first initiated in the 2009. Bitcoin led to a booming set of payment services collectively known as ‘Cryptocurrency’. It was radically different from the methods of payment which existed before it. A whole new concept which was developed for the sole purpose of creating a decentralized peer-to-peer payment system. This system of payment had 0% involvement from the government side nor was it created by any government agency. The most distinguishing feature of cryptocurrency is that no single user has control over the entire system.\r\n\r\n![crypto-currency](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/2_Wv0umhG.max-800x600.jpg)\r\n\r\n# History of Bitcoin:\r\n\r\nDue to the 2008 financial crisis in U.S and Europe, people lost their trust in banks, the government and other financial institutions as these were the institutions that regulated the flow of payments. Bitcoin or the concept of cryptocurrencies was come up with solely for this purpose. It was invented by a group of tech savvy people who were victims to the financial depression in 2008. As a result of which people started to familiarize themselves with bitcoin as an alternative form of payment which is not only more profitable for the users, but also an extremely safe and universal form of payment as all users use the same currency (bitcoin,ether etc.). And most importantly it eliminated the need for banks and government regulations thus eliminating third party involvement in the transaction.\r\n\r\n![crypto-currency](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/3_zI8i0U5.max-800x600.png)\r\n\r\n# How Does Cryptocurrency work:\r\n\r\nCryptocurrency works primarily by encoding using high level of programming to store and transmit cryptocurrency data between data wallets and/or public ledgers. Each user can choose to conceal his/her identity or profile on the cryptocurrency platform that he/she is using. Each user would be given a public and private key. A public key is known to other users of cryptocurrency too. Direct transactions can be made to another person just by knowing his public key. On the other hand, the private key is specific to each individual and only the individual would have access to his/her private key. The way the platform is set up is such that there involves a block which represent transactions made between users.\r\n\r\nThe reason cryptocurrency is very safe is because the encryption algorithms used are the best in the world and only a few computer machines are capable of encrypting transaction data. This leads to the concept of bitcoin mining which can be done if you have computer machines capable of running the encryption algorithms. As a reward for the computational power of your machine, you are given bitcoin based on how much computation your machine has performed. Another security feature of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is that a hacker cannot modify the data or access the data of a transaction made (a block of transactions in this case), he would have to modify the block transaction data of all the blocks that precede the block to which he has made changes. This is computationally not possible because it would require an enormous amount of computational power (more than 50% of all the bitcoin miners computational power). This is fundamentally close to impossible and not practical in real life. Thus transaction data is safeguarded from hackers.\r\n\r\n![crypto-currency](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/4.max-800x600.png)\r\n\r\n# Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency:\r\n\r\n1. Cryptocurrency’s biggest strength also turns out to be its biggest weakness. The identity of the users is not revealed, hence some people can misuse this feature and hence cryptocurrency can be widely used in the black market for transactions as their identity cannot be traced by anyone.\r\n2. Scalability: Even though cryptocurrency is widely used, it is still overshadowed by companies such as VISA, Mastercard who process significantly more payments each year. Another issue is the speed of transactions. Since the encryption algorithms are very intensive, it takes time and a lot of computational power for making a transaction.\r\n3. Market Volatility: A prime example for this factor is Elon musk who recently stopped allowing bitcoin as a form of payment. Due this action of his, the market price of Bitcoin Plummeted by about 10% this week alone and is projected to drop even further.\r\n4. Not everyone uses bitcoin. Thus a person having bitcoin can only make transactions with select people or institutions, thus reducing the flexibility of cryptocurrency.\r\n5. Most people in Underdeveloped countries do not have complete access to smart devices and the internet hence making online transactions is highly impossible and not feasible for them.\r\n\r\nAlthough Bitcoin is far from worldwide use and implementation, it is still the one of the most rapidly developing methods of payment especially during current times due to covid 19 as the branches of banks etc. Are shut down due to lockdown protocols. Thus at times like these people are starting to shift towards cryptocurrency to make various online transactions without the involvement of banks or any other government agencies and regulations.\r\n\r\n##### *WRITTEN BY  AASHISH PRATEEK- JULY 9TH, 2022*",

Recognized with Six Sigma level of accuracy, their model has earned them admirers from Britain’s Prince Charles to entrepreneur Richard Branson.\r\n\r\nNearly 5,000 men mainly depend on suburban trains to deliver home-cooked food in more than two lakh dabbas every day. The services which started 125 years ago, is now a ₹40-45-crore industry with an average monthly fee of ₹450 per box. Their whole process is linked closely to Mumbai’s railway system.\r\n\r\nMight sound surprising but a good reason for their success is very less reliance on technology and utmost dependence on human capital.\r\n\r\n![dabbawalas](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/2_jBCAH6S.max-800x600.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Business aspect:**\r\n\r\nA 2010 study by the Harvard Business School graded it “Six Sigma”, which means the dabbawalas make fewer than 3.4 mistakes per million transactions. With deliveries to and from roughly 200,000 customers each day that translates to little more than 400 delayed or missing dabbas in a year.\r\n\r\nDabbawalas claim a six-sigma accuracy level, which means only one mistake is made every 16 million deliveries. Mumbai dabbawalas are already being used as a case study, given their near-perfect managerial operations.\r\n\r\n**Trivia:**\r\n- Relying on their efficient and full-proof logistic system, Flipkart recently decided to partner with the Mumbai Dabbawalas to navigate the city streets.\r\n- They have had loyal (or should that be royal) admirers in the likes of Prince Charles (as per the folklore: of the four people from India invited to his wedding, two were dabbawalas ).\r\n- They have had a documentary made on their work by the Carnegie Mellon Professor Paul Goodman besides of course the famous HBR article.\r\n\r\n**Scope of Management:**\r\n\r\nVery less dependence on technology, which may lead to their downfall in the future generations.",

      "blog_body": "# What We Do\r\n\r\nIET NITK is an exclusive technical club under the IET Bangalore Division. We are one of the five other SIGs that form the exclusive club group in IET NITK.\r\n\r\nWe'll be using this article to explain how IET NITK works and what are the parts of our club: we'd explain our each of our SIGs work. Also make sure that you read on till they end: we have some tips and suggestions for you on how to deal with the recruitment season as well.\r\n\r\n![ietnitk_intro](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/2_2QhxmyI.max-800x600.jpg)\r\n\r\n*Our seniors from Batch of 2020 and 2021*\r\n\r\n![ietnitk_intro](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/3_BvJTWY1.max-800x600.jpg)\r\n\r\n*This is a shot from our interview with Pratyush Giri, SCP 2018*\r\n\r\n## *Cipher*\r\n\r\n![ietnitk_intro](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/4_iKRJ2ZZ.max-800x600.png)\r\n\r\n*That's our 2019 convenor Bhargav and 2020 convenor Skanda showcasing their Cipher project.*\r\n\r\nWe are the Computer Science SIG of IET NITK. Here is where you can pursue your interest in anything and everything that has a computer (and some coffee?) involved in it: from competitive programming to machine learning and from blockchain to web and mobile development.\r\n\r\nWe also have a strong presence on our IET NITK Discord channel, where we encourage people with different tastes in computer science to hang out and share resources on what they like or what they wish to learn.\r\n\r\nSome of our highlight projects are: Virtual TryOn (trying on fashion virtually via AR), Experiencing Homes in VR (Checking out homes and apartments virtually) & Face to Emoji (an ML model to convert a portrait to an emoji). None of these projects were conceived overnight: we consider and evaluate our projects each year after thorough discussions and requirements analysis.\r\n\r\nWe love to conduct events as well: we find that there is a huge trove of topics in Computer Science that we can geek about, so we encourage all our members to hold KEPs to enlighten the audience. Despite the online semester, we've held some of our highlight events like Brute Force Made Easy (our annual CP contest), CommitCon (Git and Open Source Festival) and Innerve (IET NITK's annual showcase). And this year, we have an even bigger agenda on the events side: to bring in professionals and alumni to enlighten us about their particular fields.\r\n\r\nDon't be under the impression that all we do is host public events and do projects! We also hold weekly CP preparation contests for our members before summer vacations for internship and placement season as well. And we're definitely not \"all work and no play\" either: we regularly hold SIG-wide game contests to engage all the members too.\r\n\r\n## Recruitment Process\r\n\r\nThe first step, as always, is to fill the main IET NITK recruitment form from here.

With that done, following is the process:\r\n- An online aptitude test to evaluate your knowledge.\r\n- A Technical interview to assess your knowledge about Mechanical, Civil or Chemical Engineering in general. Don't worry, we wont be testing you like professors, but we’ll also use this time to understand how you come up with ideas. We’re interested in seeing your attitude to problem solving in general.\r\n- An HR interview to know what you’re looking for and what you can offer to IET NITK and Torsion in general.\r\n\r\n## *Medium*\r\n\r\nIn Medium SIG we do video editing, graphic design and publicity for our club. It is a non-technical SIG in IET NITK. Responsibility of the Medium SIG is to increase outreach of our social media handles such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook. We create a platform where club members can express their creativity while focusing on other goals. We increase the brand awareness of our club, and keep it going. We create a good image of the club within the student community so that the best people join us. If you love creativity then this is the place you need to be at. We have conducted various KEPs such as the ones on Wondershare Filmora, Adobe Photoshop, OBS. For the summer mentorship program , IET Medium has offered an SMP on Photoshop and Graphic Design called Photoshop, Edits and GD for which there was an immense response.\r\n\r\n## Recruitment Process\r\n\r\nThe first step, as always, is to fill the main IET NITK recruitment form from here. With that done, following is the process:\r\n- A take-home assignment that you would be asked to complete in given time. Details about the assignment would be given to applicants before-hand.\r\n- A Technical interview for us to know more about you: how you are … Basically we want to understand more about you here.\r\n- An HR interview to know what you’re looking for and what you can offer to IET NITK and Medium in general.\r\n\r\n## *Inkheart*\r\n\r\n![ietnitk_intro](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/8.max-800x600.jpg)\r\n\r\nINKHEART is a non-technical SIG of IET NITK where you can explore and pursue your creative interests in literature, philosophy and creativity through a variety of activities like book reading, debating, weekly talk sessions, etc. It is a place for one’s overall skill development and we aim to keep the developing curve rising with our extensive range of exciting events along with providing an opportunity to lead amazing teams and leave your trail!\r\n\r\nOne of the prominent events of INKHEART is the ESCAPE ROOM series where distinguished speakers from different walks of life come and share their experiences. Another exciting segment is the INKHEART RECOMMENDS where we give audio reviews on a wide range of movies, series and books of different genres. Community, Ugly, Bandersnatch and The Sky Is Pink are some of the popular shows and movies we have reviewed so far and more are yet to come on the list. A session on “The art of cinematic soundscapes” to take you through the process of music production skills and make some tunes, because if it sounds good, it is good Book reviews and Freshers Debate were other spectacular events. Last summer was a happening one with three interesting Summer Mentorship Programmes from Inkheart which included Maestro of Rhetorics, French for Beginners and Lights Camera Script.\r\n\r\nWe love to have fun while learning, so not only do we organize events for the development of the student community, but also have some exciting rounds of games, team bonding sessions, biweekly debate sessions and more fun-filled activities to refresh ourselves from the boredom of academics.\r\n\r\n## Recruitment Process\r\n\r\nThe first step, as always, is to fill the main IET NITK recruitment form from here. With that done, following is the process:\r\n- A take-home assignment that you would be asked to complete in given time. Details about the assignment would be given to applicants before-hand.\r\n- A group discussion to see how you engage with others and gauge how well you can come up with cool ideas.\r\n- An interview for us to know more about you: how you are … Basically we want to understand more about you here.\r\n- An HR interview to know what you’re looking for and what you can offer to IET NITK and Inkheart in general.\r\n\r\n## *Venture*\r\n\r\nVenture SIG is a platform to learn and build up and explore the domains in the field of commerce, economics, management and much more.\r\n\r\nEven though being the latest member of the IET NITK family, we have planned upon our upcoming project ideas. Some of them are Stock Trading Bot, Blockchain based peer to peer mobile payment platform, Merger and Acquisition case study, Mock Start-up case study and much more.\r\n\r\nOne of the trademark events that we conducted was TRADEVERSE. Tradeverse provided a platform to gain first hand experience on the Stock market as well as training. The KEP we provided gave everyone a strong basis about the same and the next two days of virtual trading provided everyone the best place to learn and acquire new skills as well as interact with many people during these hard times. And, the whole event had an added bonus of cash prizes for its winners. We have also started a mini video series where we provide information as well as the basis of different fields related to business, management and economics. Our first short clip on Entrepreneurship provided solid understanding about the same.\r\n\r\nWe conduct interesting and exciting events not only for everyone but specifically for members as well. The IPL auction event conducted for club members proved to be successful as well as engaging. Different team involved in a fun and intense auction was just the perfect thing we needed to cool out our mind but also gave us insight into various aspects of auctioning as well.\r\n\r\n## Recruitment Process\r\n\r\nThe first step, as always, is to fill the main IET NITK recruitment form from here. With that done, following is the process:\r\n- A Technical + Aptitude test to evaluate your knowledge.\r\n- A Technical interview for us to know more about you: how you approach problems in the fields of our interest and what are your views to some of the current problems faced in finance/economics.\r\n- An HR interview to know what you’re looking for and what you can offer to IET NITK and Venture in general.\r\n\r\n## *Tips for Recruitment Season*\r\n\r\n![ietnitk_intro](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/9.max-800x600.jpg)\r\n\r\n*That's how a recruitment interview would've been if college wasn't virtual ... This is from one of the rooms in Main Building.*\r\n\r\nWe have some tips for you on how to handle the season:\r\n- Most importantly, keep calm throughout.\r\n- Keep an open mind during the interviews: speak what you’re thinking.\r\n- Be honest with your expectations: both what you can deliver as well as what the club can give you.\r\n- Ask questions: the test would prove your technical capabilities, but club interviews are mostly about how",

      "blog_body": "# Indian Football\r\n\r\n![ietnitk_intro](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/2_B7AyRcY.max-800x600.jpg)\r\n\r\nFootball, a game played by two teams of 11 players, using a round ball that players kick up and down the rectangular playing field. Teams try to kick the ball into the other team’s goal. But for some it’s more than just a game. For some, it’s what they believe their lives revolve around. They forget everything they have once they’ve started watching a game of football, I myself broke my phone cheering in the World Cup.\r\n\r\nIndia has a long and storied history in the world of soccer, with the country having a national team that has been participating in international tournaments for decades. However, despite the passion for the sport that exists within the country, India has struggled to make much of an impact on the global stage.\r\n\r\nOne of the main challenges that the Indian national team has faced is the lack of resources and infrastructure available for the sport. Unlike many other countries, soccer has not traditionally been the most popular sport in India, and as a result, the sport has not received the same level of investment and support. This has made it difficult for the national team to compete with other countries that have more advanced facilities and training programs.\r\n\r\nOnce regarded as one the the best teams in Asia, the Indian team had its golden era during the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, India won gold in the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games and finished fourth in the 1956 Summer Olympics. India thus became the first Asian nation to reach the semi-finals of a major tournament organized by FIFA. India never participated in the FIFA World Cup, despite being qualified for the 1950 FIFA World Cup but withdrew before the start of the tournament for unspecified reasons. The Indian national team is one of the strongest teams in South Asia, appearing in the AFC Asian Cup (Asia’s highest football championship) four times and finishing as runner-up once in 1964. India also participates in the SAFF Championship (South Asia’s highest football tournament). It has won the tournament a record eighth times since its inception in 1993, making India the most successful team in the region.\r\n\r\nIn recent years within India, however, there have been  some efforts to try and improve the state of soccer in India. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has been working to develop a more professional league system, and there have been efforts to build new stadiums and improve the infrastructure for the sport.\r\n\r\nDespite these efforts, there is still a long way to go before India can be considered a major player in the world of soccer. The country is currently ranked 108th in the world by FIFA. However, there is hope that with continued investment and development, India will be able to improve its standing in the world of soccer and make a greater impact on the global stage.\r\n\r\n## FIFA over the years\r\n\r\nThe Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) is the international governing body for the sport of soccer. It was founded in 1904 and is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland. Over the years, FIFA has played a vital role in the growth and development of soccer as a global sport.\r\n\r\nOne of the main responsibilities of FIFA is to organize and oversee international soccer tournaments, including the World Cup and the Women's World Cup. These tournaments are some of the most watched and celebrated sporting events in the world, and they serve as a platform for national teams from all over the globe to compete against each other.\r\n\r\nIn addition to organizing international tournaments, FIFA is also responsible for setting the rules and regulations for the sport, as well as establishing standards for player transfers and contracts. The organization also works to promote the growth of soccer in countries around the world, through initiatives such as the FIFA Forward program, which aims to provide financial and technical assistance to member associations.\r\n\r\nOver the years, FIFA has faced numerous challenges and controversies. One of the most significant was the corruption scandal that came to light in 2015, in which several top FIFA officials were indicted on charges of bribery and corruption. This led to widespread reforms within the organization, including the introduction of term limits for top officials and the establishment of an independent ethics committee.\r\n\r\nDespite these challenges, FIFA has continued to play a central role in the world of soccer, and it remains one of the most powerful and influential sports organizations in the world.\r\n\r\n##  TOP 10 Legendary Players\r\n\r\nBeing such a popular sport, football has also given some of the most recognizable sports people on earth. Many of them have reached legendary status and here, we’ve listed down the 10 greatest football legends.\r\n\r\n### Pele\r\n\r\nPele is often considered the finest player of the 20th century . He is the only player in the world to win 3 FIFA World Cups. Pele has scored  over 1,200 goals in more than 1,300 matches and won three World Cups with his National Team of Brazil (Sweden 1958, Chile 1962, Mexico 1970) .  He burst onto the scene in the 1958 World Cup as a 17-year old and was instrumental in his country’s first World Cup win . Pele’s legacy remains as strong as ever.\r\n\r\n### DIEGO MARADONA\r\n\r\nNicknamed the Golden Boy for his early promise, Starting his career with  Boca Juniors, Maradona rose to prominence on the world stage during his time at FC Barcelona and Napoli . Argentina’s world cup quarter-final against England became one of the most famous games in football history Maradona’s goal of the game encapsulated his brilliance . This illegitimate goal scored by Maradona is referred to as the “Hand of God” . \r\n\r\n### LIONEL MESSI\r\n\r\nLionel Messi is widely regarded  as one of the greatest players of his generation .\tHe is a current  Captain of  Argentina and ex-captain of Barcelona .  He  has a record of  seven Ballon d’ors and six European Golden shoes . He’s spent his whole career at Barcelona , and won 4 champions leagues and 10 La Liga titles with the club .

      "blog_body": "# Ion Thrusters\r\n\r\nAn ion thruster which is also called as ion drive or ion engine is a kind of electric propulsion which is generally used for spacecraft propulsion. The main function of this ion thruster is that it creates thrust by accelerating ions with the help of electricity. An ion thruster uses propellant. A propellant is a gas like Xenon. These thrusters ionize a neutral gas or inert gas by extracting some electrons out of atoms, to create more number of positive ions. Ion thrusters depend on electrostatics or electromagnetics as these ions get accelerated by Coulomb force along electric field or by Lorentz force.\r\n\r\n![ion-thrusters](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/1_2WQ3igb.max-800x600.png)\r\n\r\nThe working principle of these ion thrusters is by using electrically charged atoms or molecules to create thrust in accordance with momentum conservation. Ion thrusters are categorized either as electrostatic or electromagnetic. The main difference is the method for which the ions accelerate. ❖ Electrostatic ion thrusters use the Coulomb force and accelerate the ions in the direction of the electric field. ❖ Electromagnetic ion thrusters use the Lorentz force to move the ions.\r\n\r\n### **Current use of Ion thrusters**\r\n\r\nIon thrusters (based on a NASA design) are now being used to keep over 100 geosynchronous Earth orbit communication satellites in their desired locations, and three NSTAR ion thrusters that utilize Glenn-developed technology are enabling the Dawn spacecraft (launched in 2007) to travel deep into our solar system. Dawn is the first spacecraft to orbit two objects in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter: the protoplanets Vesta and Ceres.\r\n\r\n![ion-thrusters](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/2_Vi1iRLW.max-800x600.png)\r\n\r\n### **Current use of Ion thrusters**\r\n\r\nThe main advantage is that they can achieve extremely high Specific Thrusts (ISPs) compared to other rocket engines such as booster rockets. Therefore, ion thrusters can achieve high specific impulses. The main drawback is low acceleration. Because the mass of electric power unit is directly proportional to amount of power.\r\n\r\n### **Conclusion**\r\n\r\nIon thrusters have proven to be a viable and powerful alternative to conventional debugging systems. with very low fuel demand due to the very high specific current generation ion thrusters can easily compete with chemical systems even if the output power is very low.",

      "blog_body": "![metaverse](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/1_BfSGomk.max-800x600.png)\r\n\r\n# Entry To The Metaverse: A Virtual World\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnology is ever-changing and, because of that, so is marketing. The evolution of the metaverse is just one recent development in the world of technology, but one that will have a huge impact on the human experience as we know it. In this post, we will introduce the metaverse. This will include a breakdown of what it means and a look at both its current and future states.\r\n\r\n## What is The Metaverse?\r\n\r\nMetaverse is a virtual world based on blockchain technology. This all-encompassing space allows users to work and play in a virtual reflection of real-life and fantasy scenarios, an online reality, ranging from sci-fi and dragons to more practical and familiar settings like shopping centers, offices, and even homes. Users can access metaverses via computer, handheld device, or complete immersion with a VR headset. Those entering the metaverse get to experience living in a digital realm, where they will be able to work, play, shop, exercise and socialize.\r\n\r\n## Metaverse and NFT: How Are They Related?\r\n\r\nAn NFT, or non-fungible token, is anything digital that cannot be replaced as it doesn’t have a tangible value. The most common forms of NFT today are digital art like animations. However, within the metaverse, an NFT can become so much more. NFTs are revolutionizing the gaming business by allowing players to own and benefit from the stuff they acquire or build in the game, as well as carry those profits or assets into real life. Previously, if you played a game like Axie Infinity (AXS), the awards you earned were exclusively redeemable in that game. Axie players can now win cryptocurrency incentives that have real-world worth.\r\n\r\n## Metaverse Events\r\n\r\nIn this post-COVID world, it’s easy to imagine the continued need for virtual meeting spaces. From family get-togethers to concerts to non-profit galas, the metaverse has no limits on who you can meet up with and when. A metaverse startup company recently sold 620 virtual sneakers for $3.1 million in less than 5 minutes. A Snoop Dogg fan paid $450,000 to be his next-door neighbor in the virtual world. Justin Bieber organized a concert in the metaverse and fans went meta-crazy. While metaverse is still in development, these new worlds offer exciting social and financial possibilities in the future. Metaverse can provide users with new opportunities to play, invest and socialize. While progress on the different unique metaverse platforms is notable, it is the ability for the numerous metaverse games to interact and interoperate with one another that has the potential to turn the nascent blockchain gaming ecosystem into a worldwide economic pillar.",

      "title": "Razor And Blade Business Model",
      "blog_body": "*\"Give them the razors and make them come back for blades\".*\r\n\r\nThis was the marketing strategy adopted by King Gillette in the 1900s when he invented the disposable safety razor. This revolutionized the shaving industry. The razors were sold at a low price, making them popular, but only the blades produced by him would fit them. He made a fortune by selling patented razor blades.\r\n\r\nToday, the net worth of Gillette is approximately 7.55 billion U.S. dollars!! The razor blade business model involves selling a product at a lower price, then selling a related product later for a profit.\r\n\r\nGillette is one of those few companies that has been in the market for more than 100 years surviving seven revolutions and two world wars! In the late 19th century, there were only two kinds of razor blades used, viz., Straight razor and safety razor. The Straight razors were considered too risky because they were super sharp. The safety razor was like a one-time purchase, but once you bought it you had to frequently keep sharpening it.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the prices and to make shaving affordable for everyone, a traveling salesman named King Camp Gillette came up with the idea of detachable disposable blades with a single razor. This became a huge hit in the early 1900s, and Gillette became the market leader for about 15 years, but the sales were down by 20% in just one year once the patent ended in 1921.\r\n\r\n![razor-blade](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/2.max-800x600_5VZMxC9.png)\r\n\r\nThis is when the revolutionary idea of the razor blade model came into existence. Gillette sold the razors at an ultra-low price and sometimes even at a loss while capping the price of blades at a higher margin. Once the customer buys razors from Gillette, the customer has entered the \"Gillette's Ecosystem\" and there is no going back. So the customer keeps buying the blades we can have a recurring profit from each customer. After 1922 when the razor blade strategy was fully implemented, the sales of Gillette razors skyrocketed by a humongous 127%.\r\n\r\nThe product(razor) is appealing as it is sold at a low price. It then implicitly forces the customers to buy related products (blades) ensuring study revenue. It also creates customer loyalty as the customer gets used to the current product and may think twice to switch to a different company and there are also potential high psychological switching costs. By developing and providing various kinds of related products(blades) the company gives customers freedom and flexibility to choose from a wide variety of products.\r\n\r\nAside from razor blades themselves, there are many other brands in different industries utilizing this business model. Gaming industries extensively use razor and blade business model. Sony uses its pricing model and sells its PlayStation consoles at a loss, just so that they can make recurring profits through CDs and PlayStation Plus subscriptions. Microsoft makes no money on the sale of its Xbox One X game console\r\n\r\neven at an average $499 price, but it gets about $7 out of each $60 video game. Keurig sells a range of single-serve coffee makers, with some available for less than $100, where it makes money in the sale of coffee pods, with a 6-pack alone retailing for around $20. Amazon Kindle today is being sold at almost 0 profit just so that Amazon can make billions out of its e-book sales.\r\n\r\nLike every strategy, even this 'almost best' strategy has its own drawbacks. The biggest threat to the razor and blades business model is competition. Other companies may attempt to maintain their consumable monopoly (and maintain their margin) by preventing competitors from selling products that match with their durable goods. For example, computer printer manufacturers will make it difficult to use third-party ink cartridges, and razor manufacturers will prevent cheaper generic blade refills from mating with their razors. If a competitor offers a comparable consumable product at a lower price, the sales of the original company's product suffer, and their margin erodes. Brands that implement the razor-blade model always run the risk that they will not recoup their initial costs. If the business is heavily subsidizing the initial product, poor sales in the premium product may result in an overall loss.\r\n\r\nBusinesses need to understand that this model is a double edge sword because if they are too dependent on this strategy, they might end up like Kodak. They were so stuck in making money by selling their film rolls that despite being one of the first companies to file a patent for digital cameras, they did not realize that the film roll itself will cease to exist with the rise of the digital revolution. From being the leader of cameras to disappearing from the market itself just because of depending too much on this model.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this model yields maximum user retention. If this method is implemented correctly with a well-planned pricing strategy taking into account all other confounders and factors, ensuring flexibility and customer loyalty, it can do wonders. This is a proven fact, and this is how the Razor Blade strategy is being used by the top industries like Apple, Sony, Amazon, One-Plus, etc. and has become the billion-dollar strategy.",

      "blog_body": "# Warp Drive: Key To Faster Than Light Travel\r\n\r\n\r\nHumans have always been curious beings. We have an inherent drive to explore. We started from venturing out of our caves and made it to the point where we are venturing into the inky depths of space. But space travel is not an easy task. Lifting things off the ground and putting them into orbit or moving them across vast emptiness of space requires a lot of energy, resources, and time. The ordinary chemical powered rockets which we use today are developed in the mid 20th century. The basic concept of how rocket engines and motors work did not change from then till date. But the human mind always yearns for more and does not stop.\r\n\r\nA warp drive is a fictional propulsion system in many science fiction works and is a subject of ongoing physics research. The general concept of warp drive was introduced by a 1957 novel, Islands of space written by John W. Campbell and popularized by the series Star trek.Einstein, in his paper published in 1905 on Special theory of relativity, theorized that an object passing through space will bend space due to its mass and inflates time as it goes faster. The ratio of these two has a maximum limit which is the speed of light and is constant. Anything that has mass requires an infinite amount of energy to reach this limit, much less to overcome it.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, Miguel Alcubierre while doing his PhD study at Cardiff university in Wales, proposed a method for changing the geometry of spacetime by creating a wave that would cause the space ahead of a spacecraft to contract and the space behind it to expand. The ship would then ride this wave inside a region of space, known as a warp bubble, and would not move within this bubble but instead be carried along as the bubble itself moves due to the actions of the curved space-time that pulls and pushes the spacecraft from both ends. Since the ship is not moving through space-time but moving space-time itself, relativistic effects like time dilation would not apply, allowing faster-than-light travel.\r\n\r\n![SPACE](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/1_EMiFGgQ.max-800x600.png)\r\n\r\nAlthough it is a theoretically sound concept, it is still far away from implementation in labs for testing it and to practically work out because of two reasons primarily.\r\n- The amount of positive and negative energy needed to create a warp bubble still is the biggest challenge associated with this concept. Currently, scientists believe that the only way to support the negative energy density needed to produce the warp bubble is through exotic matter. While the mechanics of an Alcubierre drive works with Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, the creation of negative energy densities is an unknown technology due to a lack of understanding on dark energy and exotic matter and therefore may be impossible. Scientists also estimate that the total energy requirement would be equivalent to the mass of Jupiter.\r\n- Space is not just empty between any two given points. It is full of cosmic particles of varying properties. Researchers from the University of Sydney have done some calculations on the effects of faster than light space travel taking into consideration all the particles an Alcubierre drive spacecraft might face while travelling. They found that the particles can get swept up into the warp bubble and focused into regions around the ship, as well as within the warp bubble itself. When the spacecraft reaches its destination, the particles its bubble has gathered are released in energetic outbursts that can destroy anyone standing directly in front of it.\r\n\r\nBut some researchers are hopeful that these difficulties that they face in creating this technology are possible to overcome. The energy estimates being equivalent to the mass of Jupiter for achieving faster than light travel is already much better compared to the older estimate of energy requirement of infinity. As time goes on, many more discoveries and ideas will improve our understanding of our universe and have better tools. If historical cases are any sign, eventually the technology needed to build an Alcubierre drive may pass a point of no return and suddenly seem entirely possible and we can travel to distant galaxies much faster than light itself. As Captain James T. Kirk said in Star Trek, to explore space, the final frontier, is to boldly go where no man has gone before.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.
