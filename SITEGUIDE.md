#### Team Update
All members of IET NITK would have a page on the website which would list their IET projects and the blog articles they have written. 

To make this happen, every author must fill up the Google Form (collect it from any Core member) with their details. Once the form is filled, the site administrator should make a new folder under "_authors" folder, with filename *short-name*.md 

In this file, please follow the following format:
_____
\-\-\-
short_name: *short_name*

name: *full-member-name*

position: *position-within-club*

facebook: *facebook-handle*

github: *github-handle*

linkedin: *linkedin-handle*

img: *image-of-author*

layout: author
\-\-\-

**Make sure the short-name mentioned in these forms are used in the blogs too.** The short-name is like a username for the website, and all authors are identified by this username.
