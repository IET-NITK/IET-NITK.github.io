Football, a game played by two teams of 11 players, using a round ball that players kick up and down the rectangular playing field. Teams try to kick the ball into the other team’s goal. But for some it’s more than just a game. For some, it’s what they believe their lives revolve around. They forget everything they have once they’ve started watching a game of football, I myself broke my phone cheering in the World Cup.

India has a long and storied history in the world of soccer, with the country having a national team that has been participating in international tournaments for decades. However, despite the passion for the sport that exists within the country, India has struggled to make much of an impact on the global stage.

One of the main challenges that the Indian national team has faced is the lack of resources and infrastructure available for the sport. Unlike many other countries, soccer has not traditionally been the most popular sport in India, and as a result, the sport has not received the same level of investment and support. This has made it difficult for the national team to compete with other countries that have more advanced facilities and training programs.

Once regarded as one the the best teams in Asia, the Indian team had its golden era during the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, India won gold in the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games and finished fourth in the 1956 Summer Olympics. India thus became the first Asian nation to reach the semi-finals of a major tournament organized by FIFA. India never participated in the FIFA World Cup, despite being qualified for the 1950 FIFA World Cup but withdrew before the start of the tournament for unspecified reasons. The Indian national team is one of the strongest teams in South Asia, appearing in the AFC Asian Cup (Asia’s highest football championship) four times and finishing as runner-up once in 1964. India also participates in the SAFF Championship (South Asia’s highest football tournament). It has won the tournament a record eighth times since its inception in 1993, making India the most successful team in the region.

In recent years within India, however, there have been  some efforts to try and improve the state of soccer in India. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has been working to develop a more professional league system, and there have been efforts to build new stadiums and improve the infrastructure for the sport.

Despite these efforts, there is still a long way to go before India can be considered a major player in the world of soccer. The country is currently ranked 108th in the world by FIFA. However, there is hope that with continued investment and development, India will be able to improve its standing in the world of soccer and make a greater impact on the global stage.

## FIFA over the years

The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) is the international governing body for the sport of soccer. It was founded in 1904 and is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland. Over the years, FIFA has played a vital role in the growth and development of soccer as a global sport.

One of the main responsibilities of FIFA is to organize and oversee international soccer tournaments, including the World Cup and the Women's World Cup. These tournaments are some of the most watched and celebrated sporting events in the world, and they serve as a platform for national teams from all over the globe to compete against each other.

In addition to organizing international tournaments, FIFA is also responsible for setting the rules and regulations for the sport, as well as establishing standards for player transfers and contracts. The organization also works to promote the growth of soccer in countries around the world, through initiatives such as the FIFA Forward program, which aims to provide financial and technical assistance to member associations.

Over the years, FIFA has faced numerous challenges and controversies. One of the most significant was the corruption scandal that came to light in 2015, in which several top FIFA officials were indicted on charges of bribery and corruption. This led to widespread reforms within the organization, including the introduction of term limits for top officials and the establishment of an independent ethics committee.

Despite these challenges, FIFA has continued to play a central role in the world of soccer, and it remains one of the most powerful and influential sports organizations in the world.
