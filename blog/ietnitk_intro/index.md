# What We Do
##### *BY  VISHWA MOHAN TIWARI AND LAKSH SADHWANI - OCTOBER 7TH, 2022*

IET NITK is an exclusive technical club under the IET Bangalore Division. We are one of the five other SIGs that form the exclusive club group in IET NITK.

We'll be using this article to explain how IET NITK works and what are the parts of our club: we'd explain our each of our SIGs work. Also make sure that you read on till they end: we have some tips and suggestions for you on how to deal with the recruitment season as well.

*That's our 2019 convenor Bhargav and 2020 convenor Skanda showcasing their Cipher project.*

We are the Computer Science SIG of IET NITK. Here is where you can pursue your interest in anything and everything that has a computer (and some coffee?) involved in it: from competitive programming to machine learning and from blockchain to web and mobile development.

We also have a strong presence on our IET NITK Discord channel, where we encourage people with different tastes in computer science to hang out and share resources on what they like or what they wish to learn.

Some of our highlight projects are: Virtual TryOn (trying on fashion virtually via AR), Experiencing Homes in VR (Checking out homes and apartments virtually) & Face to Emoji (an ML model to convert a portrait to an emoji). None of these projects were conceived overnight: we consider and evaluate our projects each year after thorough discussions and requirements analysis.

We love to conduct events as well: we find that there is a huge trove of topics in Computer Science that we can geek about, so we encourage all our members to hold KEPs to enlighten the audience. Despite the online semester, we've held some of our highlight events like Brute Force Made Easy (our annual CP contest), CommitCon (Git and Open Source Festival) and Innerve (IET NITK's annual showcase). And this year, we have an even bigger agenda on the events side: to bring in professionals and alumni to enlighten us about their particular fields.

Don't be under the impression that all we do is host public events and do projects! We also hold weekly CP preparation contests for our members before summer vacations for internship and placement season as well. And we're definitely not "all work and no play" either: we regularly hold SIG-wide game contests to engage all the members too.

## Recruitment Process

Venture SIG is a platform to learn and build up and explore the domains in the field of commerce, economics, management and much more.

Even though being the latest member of the IET NITK family, we have planned upon our upcoming project ideas. Some of them are Stock Trading Bot, Blockchain based peer to peer mobile payment platform, Merger and Acquisition case study, Mock Start-up case study and much more.

One of the trademark events that we conducted was TRADEVERSE. Tradeverse provided a platform to gain first hand experience on the Stock market as well as training. The KEP we provided gave everyone a strong basis about the same and the next two days of virtual trading provided everyone the best place to learn and acquire new skills as well as interact with many people during these hard times. And, the whole event had an added bonus of cash prizes for its winners. We have also started a mini video series where we provide information as well as the basis of different fields related to business, management and economics. Our first short clip on Entrepreneurship provided solid understanding about the same.

We conduct interesting and exciting events not only for everyone but specifically for members as well. The IPL auction event conducted for club members proved to be successful as well as engaging. Different team involved in a fun and intense auction was just the perfect thing we needed to cool out our mind but also gave us insight into various aspects of auctioning as well.

## *Tips for Recruitment Season*

![ietnitk_intro](../../assets/images/blog/ietnitk_intro/9.jpg)

*That's how a recruitment interview would've been if college wasn't virtual ... This is from one of the rooms in Main Building.*

We have some tips for you on how to handle the season:
- Most importantly, keep calm throughout.
- Keep an open mind during the interviews: speak what you’re thinking.
- Be honest with your expectations: both what you can deliver as well as what the club can give you.
- Ask questions: the test would prove your technical capabilities, but club interviews are mostly about how
