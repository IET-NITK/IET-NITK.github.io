Imagine a world where banks aren’t involved as third parties in transactions and a direct interaction between the sender and receiver is established, and the hassle of currency exchange is eliminated . ‘Cryptocurrency’ is a fairly popular terms familiar to most people. But not many know it’s applications and advantages over the conventional type of currencies which are more widely used in today’s world.

# Introduction to cryptocurrency:

The concept of Cryptocurrency was first initiated in the 2009. Bitcoin led to a booming set of payment services collectively known as ‘Cryptocurrency’. It was radically different from the methods of payment which existed before it. A whole new concept which was developed for the sole purpose of creating a decentralized peer-to-peer payment system. This system of payment had 0% involvement from the government side nor was it created by any government agency. The most distinguishing feature of cryptocurrency is that no single user has control over the entire system.

# History of Bitcoin:

Due to the 2008 financial crisis in U.S and Europe, people lost their trust in banks, the government and other financial institutions as these were the institutions that regulated the flow of payments. Bitcoin or the concept of cryptocurrencies was come up with solely for this purpose. It was invented by a group of tech savvy people who were victims to the financial depression in 2008. As a result of which people started to familiarize themselves with bitcoin as an alternative form of payment which is not only more profitable for the users, but also an extremely safe and universal form of payment as all users use the same currency (bitcoin,ether etc.). And most importantly it eliminated the need for banks and government regulations thus eliminating third party involvement in the transaction.

# How Does Cryptocurrency work:

Cryptocurrency works primarily by encoding using high level of programming to store and transmit cryptocurrency data between data wallets and/or public ledgers. Each user can choose to conceal his/her identity or profile on the cryptocurrency platform that he/she is using. Each user would be given a public and private key. A public key is known to other users of cryptocurrency too. Direct transactions can be made to another person just by knowing his public key. On the other hand, the private key is specific to each individual and only the individual would have access to his/her private key. The way the platform is set up is such that there involves a block which represent transactions made between users.

The reason cryptocurrency is very safe is because the encryption algorithms used are the best in the world and only a few computer machines are capable of encrypting transaction data. This leads to the concept of bitcoin mining which can be done if you have computer machines capable of running the encryption algorithms. As a reward for the computational power of your machine, you are given bitcoin based on how much computation your machine has performed. Another security feature of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is that a hacker cannot modify the data or access the data of a transaction made (a block of transactions in this case), he would have to modify the block transaction data of all the blocks that precede the block to which he has made changes. This is computationally not possible because it would require an enormous amount of computational power (more than 50% of all the bitcoin miners computational power). This is fundamentally close to impossible and not practical in real life. Thus transaction data is safeguarded from hackers.

# Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency:
1. Cryptocurrency’s biggest strength also turns out to be its biggest weakness. The identity of the users is not revealed, hence some people can misuse this feature and hence cryptocurrency can be widely used in the black market for transactions as their identity cannot be traced by anyone.
2. Scalability: Even though cryptocurrency is widely used, it is still overshadowed by companies such as VISA, Mastercard who process significantly more payments each year. Another issue is the speed of transactions. Since the encryption algorithms are very intensive, it takes time and a lot of computational power for making a transaction.
3. Market Volatility: A prime example for this factor is Elon musk who recently stopped allowing bitcoin as a form of payment. Due this action of his, the market price of Bitcoin Plummeted by about 10% this week alone and is projected to drop even further.
4. Not everyone uses bitcoin. Thus a person having bitcoin can only make transactions with select people or institutions, thus reducing the flexibility of cryptocurrency.
5. Most people in Underdeveloped countries do not have complete access to smart devices and the internet hence making online transactions is highly impossible and not feasible for them.

Although Bitcoin is far from worldwide use and implementation, it is still the one of the most rapidly developing methods of payment especially during current times due to covid 19 as the branches of banks etc. Are shut down due to lockdown protocols. Thus at times like these people are starting to shift towards cryptocurrency to make various online transactions without the involvement of banks or any other government agencies and regulations.
