Also '=0' is already understood by the model so user need not write it. So if the equation is 15a=45, then user need to write 15a-45 and then upload it on the website.\n- The user uploads an image to the website as shown below:-\n![eq](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161968276-040dad35-b81d-4a47-b595-f428496ff800.jpeg)\n- Then the image is processed and converted to desired image that model wants as shown below.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161968517-78d5adaf-96bc-472b-a5c2-7dbab94c7bdf.png)\n- Model then detect that an equation with **variable 'a'** has been uploaded & generates the following output.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161969317-027e503f-a9a7-45b4-b077-d06458b8e9b0.png)\n- Similarly for **Linear Equation in two variable** user need to upload two Images as shown below:-\n![eq1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161969873-2dd69652-67b2-4930-9de3-c97184875e3c.jpeg)\n![eq2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161969912-505cc709-95ba-492b-bfd7-dcce54944027.jpeg)\n- Again Model coverts both images as desired images & Solves it!!\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161970223-07b7aaa5-ef10-49d9-b28e-d6ff49df8766.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161970272-64c63894-d011-4e15-9264-5f33c4609531.png)\n- **Model produces Following output:-**\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161970375-8d5d9888-e699-4a15-819d-52a759ddd2cc.png)\n\n## Why CNN?\n- In traditional Neural Networks, one need to specify the important features to be considered while **CNN** automatically detects the important features without any **Human Supervision.**\n- Our project involved **high level pixel processing** and CNN's are considered to be the best for that as it can learn the key features for any class itself.\n- **CNN's** even have better accuracy than any other **Machine Learning Model** when it comes to **\"Detection\"**.Hence CNN was the best thing to be used for this project.\n\n## Challenges We ran into\n- When we trained the CNN Model for **\"=\"** , **\"(\"** & **\")\"** signs, its accuracy reduced significantly which is absurd.\n- Introducing variable **\"x\"** was challenging as **\"x\"** also represents multiplication sign. So we introduced **\"a\"** & **\"b\"** as variables.\n- User is constrained to write the equation in a paper with white unruled background. Ruled background confuses the CNN Model & it produces unusual results.\n\n## Steps to Test Backend\n- Download the **.ipynb** file from the github & upload it in **Google Colab**.\n- Also Do upload the **model** folder in the colab environment.\n- Now you may upload your own custom equations in the Colab environment & all other steps are mentioned in the .ipynb file itself.\n> Do Ensure that you crop the equation to the maximum extent.\n> Do this!!!ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡\n\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161974694-5f5fb2a0-1244-47f1-b9c5-3164d41d216c.jpeg)\n> Not this!!!ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡\n\n![eq7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161974775-dd58c278-7488-45ca-b272-f08e15a5ce46.jpeg)\n\n","date":"April 6th, 2022"},"authors":[{"name":"Lalit Nagar"},{"name":"Dolly Gupta"},{"name":"MB Sai Aditya"},{"name":"Rachana P J"}],"sig":{"name":"Cipher","logo":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/cb49a/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.png","srcSet":"/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/2e8c6/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.png 50w,\n/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/bdcb3/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.png 100w,\n/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/cb49a/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.png 200w,\n/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/1950a/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.png 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/b90ba/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.webp 50w,\n/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/d67c1/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.webp 100w,\n/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/923ce/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.webp 200w,\n/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/33402/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":200,"height":160}}}}},"url":"https://github.com/IET-NITK/HandwrittenEquationSolver","title":"Equation Solver","description":"Train a deep learning model to recognise handwritten equations from images and then give the result after solving the equations.
