Plus, it is fun just to\nchill back and engage with the project itself.\nA user can write on the video itself using their fingers in real\ntime. The input feed is taken through the webcam which is run\nthrough a python script. Using the `mediapipe` package, the hand\nis detected and segmented into 21 landmark points. The\ncoordinates obtained are in turn used to accurately locate,\ndraw, erase etc depending on the gesture made.\n\n\n\n## Methodology:\n1. Capturing the video: This is done through the webcam and it\nis accessed using the OpenCV module available in python.\nThe video had to be inverted as the default is not\nlaterally inverted.\n2. Creating the gesture recognition object: Using the\nmediapipe module provided by Google, we create a class\nobject capable of detecting the user’s hand and return the\nlist of 21 landmark points. By manipulating the\ncoordinates, we can specify the gesture and hence assign\nfunctionalities accordingly.\n3. Drawing on the video feed: Using the coordinates, we can\naccurately draw through the OpenCV module. The thickness of\nthe brush, eraser etc. can be adjusted.\n\nCHALLENGES FACED:\n1. Drawing a smooth curve: To draw on the video feed, the\nsimplest method would be to use the cv2.circle() function present in the OpenCV module. However, drawing a circle is a computationally expensive process and hence, doing it in\nreal time causes the curve to become discontinuous.\nThe solution to this was to store the list of coordinates\nobtained for every frame and make a line between every\nsubsequent coordinate. This resulted in very small lines\njoining to form a smooth curve. An analogy would be the\nmethod of plotting graphs on coordinate axes.\n2. Drawing on the video feed: While drawing on another canvas\nitself was easy, there was a neat trick involved to\nimplementing it on the video itself.\nThis can be done by applying the concepts of masking and\nbitwise operations. Please refer to the source code\nprovided for better understanding.\n\n## Alternatives\nOne can train their own model instead of using the mediapipe\nmodule available, however, the use of OpenCV would still be\ninvolved regardless.\nThe main problem with training your own model is the procurement\nof a dataset large and balanced enough to accurately detect\nhands. For the model to properly work without any bias, we need\na lot of varieties in the dataset, this is almost impossible to\nachieve on a personal basis.\nThen, arises the problem of accurately locating the coordinates\nof the fingertips. The actions involved require high precision,\nto draw, erase etc. The reason why the mediapipe module works so\nwell is because Google manually annotated more than 30,000\ntraining images with the landmark points.\n\n## Roadmap:\nThe plan ahead would be to make it more dynamic. Add more\nfunctionalities based on more gestures and make it a dev project\nas well by creating a proper application capable of running on\nany user’s system.","date":"April 7th, 2022"},"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Ibrahim"},{"name":"Krishna Poojitha Vantakula"},{"name":"Rajan Jaiswal"},{"name":"Pratik Jallan"},{"name":"Amal Majunu Vidya"}],"sig":{"name":"Cipher","logo":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/cb49a/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.png","srcSet":"/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/2e8c6/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.png 50w,\n/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/bdcb3/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.png 100w,\n/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/cb49a/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.png 200w,\n/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/1950a/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.png 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/b90ba/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.webp 50w,\n/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/d67c1/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.webp 100w,\n/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/923ce/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.webp 200w,\n/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/33402/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":200,"height":160}}}}},"url":"https://github.com/IET-NITK/IETC-RTWFC","title":"Real time writing with fingers on web camera screen","description":"This application can be used for quick explanations during\nmeetings or maybe online education.
