During this process heat is generated which may lead to failure and damage of the disc brake. In this project, we have tried to design two different models of disc brake based on the literature available. Then the steady state thermal analysis was carried out using Ansys. From this we can get to know about the heat dissipation in the two disc brakes and can come to a conclusion about which one is better.","title":"Thermal Analysis of Disc Brakes","url":null,"project_report":null,"authors":[]},{"description":"Flying and surveillance done.

This enhancement includes the reduction in drag and stall phenomenon. The dimpled airfoil has comparatively lesser drag as compared to plain airfoil. Introducing dimples on the aircraft wing will create turbulence by creating vortices which delays the boundary layer separation resulting in decrease of pressure drag and also increase in the angle of stall. In addition, wake reduction leads to reduction in acoustic emission. The objective is to improve the aircraft maneuverability by delaying the flow separation point at stall and thereby reducing the drag by applying the dimple effect over the aircraft wing.
