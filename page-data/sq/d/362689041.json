This enhancement includes the reduction in drag and stall phenomenon. The dimpled airfoil has comparatively lesser drag as compared to plain airfoil. Introducing dimples on the aircraft wing will create turbulence by creating vortices which delays the boundary layer separation resulting in decrease of pressure drag and also increase in the angle of stall. In addition, wake reduction leads to reduction in acoustic emission. The objective is to improve the aircraft maneuverability by delaying the flow separation point at stall and thereby reducing the drag by applying the dimple effect over the aircraft wing. A computational analysis has done to know the dimple effect on aircraft wing","id":"Projects_145","authors":[{"name":"Sudheer Kumar Verma"},{"name":"Shreyas S Deshpande"}]},{"name":"Face to Emoji","excerpt":"An emotion classifier that uses Resnet model it predicts 7 different emotions and according to that displays the appropriate emoji","id":"Projects_148","authors":[{"name":"Adith Shekhar Gatty"},{"name":"Akash Kumar Varanasi"},{"name":"Diksha Negi"},{"name":"Sharuf Baig"}]},{"name":"OCR for Handwritten Text","excerpt":"An API powered by a neural network model trained to recognize handwritten text from images","id":"Projects_149","authors":[{"name":"Nirmal Khedkar"},{"name":"K Snehith Bhagavan"},{"name":"Jayesh Kumar Soni"},{"name":"Uday Kumar"}]},{"name":"Jigsaw Puzzle Solver","excerpt":"The goal was to create a code where you input the pieces of any standard piece jigsaw puzzle, and the system solves the jigsaw automatically.We made use of computer vision (openCV) and basic image processing to solve the problem statement.The code is written in python and we used Jupyter notebook for running and evaluating the code","id":"Projects_151","authors":[{"name":"Diksha Negi"},{"name":"Rohit Behera"}]},{"name":"Gender Identification from Speech","excerpt":"Building a model to identify whether given speech is uttered by male or female","id":"Projects_152","authors":[{"name":"Venkat Rohit Merugu"},{"name":"M.Govardhan"}]},{"name":"Eastern western note classifier","excerpt":"We were able to analyze a simple series of musical sounds and determine each of their respective note simultaneously..","id":"Projects_154","authors":[{"name":"Sharuf Baig"}]},{"name":"Blood Flow through stents in Artery","excerpt":"The study mainly focuses on CFD analysis of blood flow through stents, placed in an artery.
