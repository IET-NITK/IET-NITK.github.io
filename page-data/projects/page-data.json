During this process heat is generated which may lead to failure and damage of the disc brake. In this project, we have tried to design two different models of disc brake based on the literature available. Then the steady state thermal analysis was carried out using Ansys. From this we can get to know about the heat dissipation in the two disc brakes and can come to a conclusion about which one is better.","sig":"Torsion","builtBy":["D Raghavi"],"label":"","url":null},{"title":"Tic-Tac-Toe AI Player","description":null,"sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Feyaz Baker"],"label":null,"url":null},{"title":"FEA and CFD Analysis of Wind Turbine Blade","description":"Wind blades play a significant role in determining a wind turbine's efficiency. Although the theoretical maximum efficiency a wind turbine can achieve is 59% with proper designing of airfoils and blades, we can obtain efficiency close to 59 percent. This project mainly focuses on analyzing a real-life engineering problem on stresses and deformations caused by aerodynamic forces acting on a wind turbine's blades by performing CFD and FEA analysis.","sig":"Torsion","builtBy":["Harhikrishnan S","S Sriram"],"label":"","url":null},{"title":"Chatbot","description":"A real time chat bot is developed to answer queries related to IET.","sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Krishna Poojitha Vantakula","Indhu Lekha","Atul Kumar"],"label":"","url":null},{"title":"Virtual Try-On","description":null,"sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["M.T.Aakash Chandra","Amal Majunu Vidya","V Madhan Kumar","Dhruv Agja"],"label":"","url":"https://github.com/aakashabhi/Virtual-Try-On"},{"title":"Face Mask Detector","description":"Detects that a person is wearing mask or not.","sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Maheshwari Mihir Premjibhai","Aniket Srivastava"],"label":"","url":"https://github.com/Mihir3101/IETC-2020-Face-Mask"},{"title":"Blood Flow through stents in Artery","description":"The study mainly focuses on CFD analysis of blood flow through stents, placed in an artery. Using CFD analysis, the phenomena of blood flow through a artery was done and recirculation of blood was found. Upon further analysis, stents were found to be the best solution to this problem and hence, a structural analysis of stent during its insertion into the artery was conducted using ANSYS.","sig":"Torsion","builtBy":["Nikitha Garapati","Abin Sibichan"],"label":"","url":null},{"title":"OCR for Handwritten Text","description":"An API powered by a neural network model trained to recognize handwritten text from images","sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Nirmal Khedkar","Jayesh Kumar Soni","K Snehith Bhagavan","Uday Kumar"],"label":"","url":"https://github.com/nirmalhk7/HandwritingRecognizer"},{"title":"Mini Jarvis","description":"Home automation demo using a Google voice assistant applet.","sig":"Rovisp","builtBy":["Nithin L N","Saurabh Gole","Ram Janam Yadav"],"label":"","url":null},{"title":"Smart Aid for Blind","description":null,"sig":"Rovisp","builtBy":["Pratigya Ranjan","Ravi Gocher","Jagan Mohan"],"label":null,"url":null},{"title":"Street Light Glow","description":"Street lights along highways during night time will be only ON when they detect vehicles on road,otherwise off.","sig":"Rovisp","builtBy":["Rameshwar Dhakad","Venkat Rohit Merugu","Sharuf Baig"],"label":"","url":null},{"title":"Experiencing Homes in VR","description":"A computer vision and deep learning based project that enables the user to try on spectacles, watches and other accessories virtually.","sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Rhevanth M","Yashwanth Reddy","Gaurav Chaurasia","Marmik Mundada","Sachin Pandey","Sowmya G","Krishna Poojitha Vantakula"],"label":"","url":null},{"title":"Net Zero Energy Building","description":"The Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) platform is a one-stop shop to learn about NZEB fundamentals, build alliances with professionals and organizations, find inspiration from case studies, explore the latest technology/policies/ideas and everything NZEB.

This enhancement includes the reduction in drag and stall phenomenon. The dimpled airfoil has comparatively lesser drag as compared to plain airfoil. Introducing dimples on the aircraft wing will create turbulence by creating vortices which delays the boundary layer separation resulting in decrease of pressure drag and also increase in the angle of stall. In addition, wake reduction leads to reduction in acoustic emission. The objective is to improve the aircraft maneuverability by delaying the flow separation point at stall and thereby reducing the drag by applying the dimple effect over the aircraft wing. A computational analysis has done to know the dimple effect on aircraft wing","sig":"Torsion","builtBy":["Sudheer Kumar Verma","Shreyas S Deshpande"],"label":"","url":null},{"title":"SC Voting App","description":"Web application for Students' Council Election.This web application let's the voting mechanism of the current student council election to go entirely online.","sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Tarun S Anur","Sahana","Suhas Gopinath"],"label":"","url":null},{"title":"Human Activity Recognition","description":"This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying using the data recorded through accelerometer and gyroscope sensors.","sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Varsha P","Dhanasekhar"],"label":null,"url":null},{"title":"Web Security and User Tracking","description":null,"sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Varsha P","Rajan Jaiswal","Satyam Jyotsana Gargee"],"label":"","url":"https://github.com/rj-since-2000/IETC-2020"},{"title":"Gender Identification from Speech","description":"Building a model to identify whether given speech is uttered by male or female","sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Venkat Rohit Merugu","Govardhan"],"label":"","url":"https://github.com/venkatrohit219/gender-detection-from-speech"},{"title":"MHD Propelled Boat","description":"Plasma Physics is not only applicable to earths core and the sun but did you ever wonder that it can propel a boat as a clear energy source of energy.
