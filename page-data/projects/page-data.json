Think of the product and the first thing that will come to your mind will surely be this brand! Can such a brand enter another industry sector and fare well in it? Or would it be disastrous? We deal with this question and the challenges that come along with it. Taking the example of the unsuccessful venture of Colgate-Palmolive, popularly known as Colgate, into the frozen-food industry, we look at what went wrong and what could be done differently if we were to give it another shot in the present times. We attempt to relaunch the product in the current market scenario. We look at the Indian frozen-food industry and analyse the same to devise a strategy wherein Colgate-Palmolive could run a successful business in the industry. ","project_report":null,"sig":{"name":"Venture"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"Naveen Patidar"}]},{"title":"Experiencing Homes in VR","description":"A computer vision and deep learning based project that enables the user to try on spectacles, watches and other accessories virtually.","project_report":null,"sig":{"name":"Cipher"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Chaurasia"},{"name":"Sachin Pandey"},{"name":"Marmik Mundada"},{"name":"Krishna Poojitha Vantakula"},{"name":"Verupaka Yashwanth Reddy"},{"name":"Sowmya G"},{"name":"Rhevanth M"}]},{"title":"Piezoelectric Shoes","description":"A piezoelectric generator is placed in the shoe.

Introducing dimples on the aircraft wing will create turbulence by creating vortices which delays the boundary layer separation resulting in decrease of pressure drag and also increase in the angle of stall. In addition, wake reduction leads to reduction in acoustic emission. The objective is to improve the aircraft maneuverability by delaying the flow separation point at stall and thereby reducing the drag by applying the dimple effect over the aircraft wing.
