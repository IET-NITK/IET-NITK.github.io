Here we worked on an MHD (Magnetohydrodynamics) boat. An innovation for the future. The basic equations of plasma physics are analysed . Complex CFD simulations alongside a prototype is proposed for MHD boats.","ongoing":false}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"MHD Propelled Boat","sig":null,"date":"2021-05-01T14:19:29.046Z"}},
