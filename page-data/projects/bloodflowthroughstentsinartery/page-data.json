Using CFD analysis, the phenomena of blood flow through a artery was done and recirculation of blood was found. Upon further analysis, stents were found to be the best solution to this problem and hence, a structural analysis of stent during its insertion into the artery was conducted using ANSYS.","ongoing":false}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"Blood Flow through stents in Artery","sig":null,"date":"2021-05-01T14:02:51.487Z"}},
