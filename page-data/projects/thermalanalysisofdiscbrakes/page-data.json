During this process heat is generated which may lead to failure and damage of the disc brake. In this project, we have tried to design two different models of disc brake based on the literature available. Then the steady state thermal analysis was carried out using Ansys. From this we can get to know about the heat dissipation in the two disc brakes and can come to a conclusion about which one is better.","ongoing":false}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"Thermal Analysis of Disc Brakes","sig":null,"date":"2021-05-01T14:32:57.299Z"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1681770253","3346060996","940918685"]}
