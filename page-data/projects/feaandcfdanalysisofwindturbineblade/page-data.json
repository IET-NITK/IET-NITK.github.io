Although the theoretical maximum efficiency a wind turbine can achieve is 59% with proper designing of airfoils and blades, we can obtain efficiency close to 59 percent. This project mainly focuses on analyzing a real-life engineering problem on stresses and deformations caused by aerodynamic forces acting on a wind turbine's blades by performing CFD and FEA analysis.","ongoing":false}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"FEA and CFD Analysis of Wind Turbine Blade","sig":null,"date":"2021-05-01T14:11:28.032Z"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1681770253","3346060996","940918685"]}
