Although the theoretical maximum efficiency a wind turbine can achieve is 59% with proper designing of airfoils and blades, we can obtain efficiency close to 59 percent. This project mainly focuses on analyzing a real-life engineering problem on stresses and deformations caused by aerodynamic forces acting on a wind turbine's blades by performing CFD and FEA analysis.","url":null}]},"member_reports":{"nodes":[]},"member_articles":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"Harhikrishnan S","sig":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3346060996","3818438335","3886595457"]}
