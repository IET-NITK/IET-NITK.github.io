Using CFD analysis, the phenomena of blood flow through a artery was done and recirculation of blood was found. Upon further analysis, stents were found to be the best solution to this problem and hence, a structural analysis of stent during its insertion into the artery was conducted using ANSYS.","sig":{"name":"Torsion"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"Abin Sibichan"},{"name":"Nikitha Garapati"}]}]},"member_articles":{"nodes":[{"title":"THE ENCHANTED REALM OF FLUID DYNAMICS","authors":[{"name":"Abin Sibichan"}],"excerpt":"Explore the science behind the flow patterns observed while trailing a boat.","date":"April 1st, 2021","route":"Fluid-dynamics"}]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"Abin Sibichan","sig":null,"date":"2021-04-29T13:15:53.867Z"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1681770253","3346060996","940918685"]}
