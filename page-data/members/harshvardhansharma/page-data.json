In the presence of high velocity wind and turbulance we aims to see effect of velocity and pressure on airfoil. With the help of velocity contour, pressure contour and turbulent kinetic energy contour we will analyse 2D airfoil. Here we have taken all data in standard form as given by NASA for example rynolds number, viscosity cooficient, density and angle of attack for airfoil.","sig":{"name":"Torsion"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"Harsh Vardhan Sharma"},{"name":"Rohit Singh"}]}]},"member_articles":{"nodes":[{"title":"Artificial Intelligence: The Way Forward","authors":[{"name":"Harsh Vardhan Sharma"}],"excerpt":"Artificial Intelligence: an overview on how is it now and where do we see it in the future","date":"September 5th, 2021","route":"new_age_tech"}]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"Harsh Vardhan Sharma","sig":null,"date":"2021-04-29T13:15:57.199Z"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1681770253","3346060996","362689041","940918685"]}
