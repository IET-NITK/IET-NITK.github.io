This enhancement includes the reduction in drag and stall phenomenon. The dimpled airfoil has comparatively lesser drag as compared to plain airfoil. Introducing dimples on the aircraft wing will create turbulence by creating vortices which delays the boundary layer separation resulting in decrease of pressure drag and also increase in the angle of stall. In addition, wake reduction leads to reduction in acoustic emission. The objective is to improve the aircraft maneuverability by delaying the flow separation point at stall and thereby reducing the drag by applying the dimple effect over the aircraft wing. A computational analysis has done to know the dimple effect on aircraft wing","sig":{"name":"Torsion"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"Sudheer Kumar Verma"},{"name":"Shreyas S Deshpande"}]}]},"memberArticles":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"Sudheer Kumar Verma","sig":null,"date":"2021-04-29T13:15:56.770Z"}},
