We used U-net and conditional GAN to solve the problem at hand. To avoid the problem of the blind leading the blind in the GAN game where neither generator nor discriminator knows anything about the task at the beginning of training, we pretrained the generator separately.","sig":{"name":"Cipher"},"url":"https://github.com/IET-NITK/ImageColorisation","authors":[{"name":"Indhu Lekha Annam"},{"name":"Varanshu Garg"},{"name":"Arunava Mukhoti"},{"name":"Diksha Negi"},{"name":"Marmik Mundada"}]},{"title":"Stock Trading Bot","description":"We designed a deep learning model that predicts the future stock price using prices/returns and volumes.","sig":{"name":"Venture"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"Naveen Patidar"},{"name":"Marmik Mundada"},{"name":"Charan Ravikumar"},{"name":"Mohammed Ibrahim"},{"name":"Vaishnavi Prakash Kalgutkar"}]}]},"memberArticles":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"Marmik Mundada","sig":null,"date":"2021-05-08T06:32:29.249Z"}},
