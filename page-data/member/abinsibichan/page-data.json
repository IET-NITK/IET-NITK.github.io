Using CFD analysis, the phenomena of blood flow through a artery was done and recirculation of blood was found. Upon further analysis, stents were found to be the best solution to this problem and hence, a structural analysis of stent during its insertion into the artery was conducted using ANSYS.","sig":{"name":"Torsion"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"Nikitha Garapati"},{"name":"Abin Sibichan"}]},{"title":"Kinematic Analysis of TMPTE","description":"We designed a Simulink model of the complex reversible coupled Ordinary differential equations  using subsystems and prepared a MATLAB code to analyse the kinetic variations of the reactants, intermediates, and products.","sig":{"name":"Torsion"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"Aman Pal"},{"name":"Abin Sibichan"},{"name":"Yash Jangid"},{"name":"Amresh Prajapati"}]}]},"memberArticles":{"nodes":[{"title":"The Enchanted Realm of Fluid Dynamics","authors":[{"name":"Abin Sibichan"}],"excerpt":"Explore the science behind the flow patterns observed while trailing a boat.","date":"April 1st, 2021","route":"Fluid-dynamics"}]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"Abin Sibichan","sig":null,"date":"2022-05-29T08:18:53.886Z"}},
