We used U-net and conditional GAN to solve the problem at hand. To avoid the problem of the blind leading the blind in the GAN game where neither generator nor discriminator knows anything about the task at the beginning of training, we pretrained the generator separately.","sig":{"name":"Cipher"},"url":"https://github.com/IET-NITK/ImageColorisation","authors":[{"name":"Indhu Lekha Annam"},{"name":"Varanshu Garg"},{"name":"Arunava Mukhoti"},{"name":"Diksha Negi"},{"name":"Marmik Mundada"}]},{"title":"Jigsaw Puzzle Solver","description":"The goal was to create a code where you input the pieces of any standard piece jigsaw puzzle, and the system solves the jigsaw automatically.We made use of computer vision (openCV) and basic image processing to solve the problem statement.The code is written in python and we used Jupyter notebook for running and evaluating the code","sig":{"name":"Torsion"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"Rohit Behera"},{"name":"Diksha Negi"}]}]},"memberArticles":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"Diksha Negi","sig":null,"date":"2021-04-29T13:15:56.487Z"}},
