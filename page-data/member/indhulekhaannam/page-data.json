We used U-net and conditional GAN to solve the problem at hand. To avoid the problem of the blind leading the blind in the GAN game where neither generator nor discriminator knows anything about the task at the beginning of training, we pretrained the generator separately.","sig":{"name":"Cipher"},"url":"https://github.com/IET-NITK/ImageColorisation","authors":[{"name":"Marmik Mundada"},{"name":"Indhu Lekha Annam"},{"name":"Diksha Negi"},{"name":"Varanshu Garg"},{"name":"Arunava Mukhoti"}]}]},"memberArticles":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"Indhu Lekha Annam","sig":null,"date":"2021-04-29T13:15:56.156Z"}},
