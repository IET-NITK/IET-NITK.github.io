Although the theoretical maximum efficiency a wind turbine can achieve is 59% with proper designing of airfoils and blades, we can obtain efficiency close to 59 percent. This project mainly focuses on analyzing a real-life engineering problem on stresses and deformations caused by aerodynamic forces acting on a wind turbine's blades by performing CFD and FEA analysis.","sig":{"name":"Torsion"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"S Sriram"},{"name":"Harhikrishnan S"}]}]},"memberArticles":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"Harhikrishnan S","sig":null,"date":"2022-05-29T08:28:06.702Z"}},
