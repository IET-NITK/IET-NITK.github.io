Also, you would not have to sit for 1st round of Club recruitment and would be directly shortlisted.

Power is gained by sharing knowledge and not by hoarding it.\n\n**Q : Which years can take SMP?**\n\nA : Mainly it is meant for 1st and 2nd years but 3rd and 4th years are welcomed as well :)\n\n**Q : What are the prerequisites for the SMP?**\n\nA : No prerequisites as such. Our mentors would be starting from level zero.\n\n**Q : Is there a limit to the number of SMPs one can take?**\n\nA : No limit! But we would recommend not taking up more than 3 to avoid overburdening, which would suck out the fun !!\n\n**Q : How to register for the SMP?**\n\nA : Fill up the registration form that is available on our official iet nitk website.\n\n**Q: What is the deadline for registration?**\n\nA : 6th May\n\n**Q: Where do I go for more information regarding an SMP?**\n\nA: Refer to the document that is shared in the Registration form and is available on our website as well.\n\n**Q : Where will the sessions take place?**\n\nA : They can happen over Meets or Teams depending upon the platform.\n\nAll the resources will be shared with the participants regularly on a common group preferably whatsapp or over their mails.\n\nFor further details, contact : \n- Vishwa Mohan Tiwari (+91 9403550573)\n - Laksh Sadhwani     (+91 9893008641)\n\n**Website**           : [https://iet.nitk.ac.in/](https://iet.nitk.ac.in/)      \n\n**Instagram**        : [https://www.instagram.com/ietnitk/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/ietnitk/?hl=en)\n\n**Linkedin**          : [https://www.linkedin.com/company/ietnitk](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ietnitk)\n\n**Telegram**         : [https://t.me/IET_NITK](https://t.me/IET_NITK)\n"},"smp":{"group":[{"fieldValue":"Torsion","nodes":[{"sig":{"logo":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"srcWebp":"/static/7bcc14be5187e958ac7fdc0738eefda6/1f5c5/caab36e11448aec3411788f3a9e7ea28.webp"}}}},"description":"CATIA is a solid modeling tool that unites the 3D parametric features with 2D tools and also addresses every design-to-manufacturing process.
