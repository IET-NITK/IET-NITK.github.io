Also, you would not have to sit for 1st round of Club recruitment and would be directly shortlisted. Plus you’ll gain hands on knowledge on the SMP you take :).\n\n**Q : When will the program begin?**\n\nA : Tentatively from 7th of May\n\n**Q : Can people from other colleges attend the SMP?**\n\nA : Of course yes. Power is gained by sharing knowledge and not by hoarding it.\n\n**Q : Which years can take SMP?**\n\nA : Mainly it is meant for 1st and 2nd years but 3rd and 4th years are welcomed as well :)\n\n**Q : What are the prerequisites for the SMP?**\n\nA : No prerequisites as such. Our mentors would be starting from level zero.\n\n**Q : Is there a limit to the number of SMPs one can take?**\n\nA : No limit! But we would recommend not taking up more than 3 to avoid overburdening, which would suck out the fun !!\n\n**Q : How to register for the SMP?**\n\nA : Fill up the registration form that is available on our official iet nitk website.\n\n**Q: What is the deadline for registration?**\n\nA : 6th May\n\n**Q: Where do I go for more information regarding an SMP?**\n\nA: Refer to the document that is shared in the Registration form and is available on our website as well.\n\n**Q : Where will the sessions take place?**\n\nA : They can happen over Meets or Teams depending upon the platform.\n\nAll the resources will be shared with the participants regularly on a common group preferably whatsapp or over their mails.\n\nFor further details, contact : \n- Marmik   (+91 8378994789)\n- Sriram        (+91 9740649410)\n\n**Website**           : [https://iet.nitk.ac.in/](https://iet.nitk.ac.in/)      \n\n**Instagram**        : [https://www.instagram.com/ietnitk/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/ietnitk/?hl=en)\n\n**LinkedIn**          : [https://www.linkedin.com/company/ietnitk](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ietnitk)\n\n**Telegram**         : [https://t.me/IET_NITK](https://t.me/IET_NITK)\n","form_url":"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnK95iCbuAlVGVNx1PiutscanNzH5HhMnqwMkBmWjjbM6iCQ/viewform"},"smp":{"group":[{"fieldValue":"Cipher","nodes":[{"sigx":{"logox":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.png"}}},"description":"This will be your gateway to learning Web Development with Javascript: only prerequisite preferred is knowledge of basic HTML.","title":"Gateway to JSVerse: Web Development with Javascript","url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RV23rWGEgeFSu5DX19AcsS6MLfPkBySc2q3W1o-7GNk/edit#heading=h.ajfp1zeoz78x","members":[{"name":"Indhu Lekha Annam"},{"name":"Amal Majunu Vidya"}]},{"sigx":{"logox":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/c5844ab334a4a1435ef1970a20dae837/Cipher_ddb0d04e8e.png"}}},"description":"Introduction to Competitive Programming from scratch.
