Using CFD analysis, the phenomena of blood flow through a artery was done and recirculation of blood was found. Upon further analysis, stents were found to be the best solution to this problem and hence, a structural analysis of stent during its insertion into the artery was conducted using ANSYS."},{"title":"Net Zero Energy Building","url":"https://nzeb.in/","builtBy":["Rithik Agrawal"],"label":null,"description":"The Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) platform is a one-stop shop to learn about NZEB fundamentals, build alliances with professionals and organizations, find inspiration from case studies, explore the latest technology/policies/ideas and everything NZEB.

This enhancement includes the reduction in drag and stall phenomenon. The dimpled airfoil has comparatively lesser drag as compared to plain airfoil. Introducing dimples on the aircraft wing will create turbulence by creating vortices which delays the boundary layer separation resulting in decrease of pressure drag and also increase in the angle of stall. In addition, wake reduction leads to reduction in acoustic emission. The objective is to improve the aircraft maneuverability by delaying the flow separation point at stall and thereby reducing the drag by applying the dimple effect over the aircraft wing. A computational analysis has done to know the dimple effect on aircraft wing"},{"title":"MHD Propelled Boat","url":null,"builtBy":["Vishwa Mohan Tiwari","Gopinath Reddy"],"label":"Expo 2021","description":"Plasma Physics is not only applicable to earths core and the sun but did you ever wonder that it can propel a boat as a clear energy source of energy.
