While many of us have been dreaming of having flying cars and talking robots in the future, some have actually turned a part of that futuristic vision into reality.\n\nIt’s not big news that the automotive industry right now is not just about IC engines and that electric cars are on the surge. Big manufacturers like BMW, Audi, Tesla, Volkswagen, Tata and many more are spending a good amount of resources into research and are adopting new technologies. So, does that mean we’ll no longer have fuel cars? What about the oil industry? Are there really going to be flying cars in the 22nd century? Well, read on to find out!\n\n![autoind.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1619868241/autoind_66a6cd2125.jpg)\n\n1.The oil & gas industries and fuel cars. Another “Kodak moment”?\n\nOf course, with the rising concerns about the environment and the depletion of natural resources, significant effort is being put in finding renewable alternatives for fuel. But, this doesn’t imply that the oil industries are going to become dodos or dinosaurs anytime soon.\n\nWith the many theories put out there by experts, various factors being “potential reasons” for oil industries to vanish are still debatable. For example, replacement by biofuels. The greenhouse gases that are emitted throughout the various stages in the production and use of biofuels, in producing the fertilizers, pesticides, and fuel used in farming, during chemical processing, transport and distribution, up to ﬁnal use. This process involves a significant amount of fossil energy itself along the entire supply chain that often makes biofuels less environment-friendly than petroleum-based fuels.\nOil and gas will still have a market, though a reduced one, in supplying feedstock to the petrochemical industry for making plastics, clothes and in air and sea transportation, where renewables or batteries are unlikely to be competitive.\n\nBut, talking about the automotive industries, with power increasingly coming from a large number of intermittent sources and from energy stored in batteries, and with consumers increasingly generating their own from solar panels, the utility model is fast-changing. The process of passing power from large generators to consumers will not support the complex power systems of the future without utilities taking a more coordinating role.\n\nFor these reasons, it is possible and increasingly likely that beyond the middle of this century fossil fuels will play little or no role in producing electric power in advanced economies. And if electric vehicles gain ground, as many in the auto industry expect, the future will be largely free of fossil fuels.\n\n\n![blog_img3.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1619868241/blog_img3_b57a637293.png)\n\n\n2.Electric cars and technology. Beginning of an era?\n\nEver since the beginning of the Digital Era, the auto industry has been constantly bringing us new technologies, whether it be for safety, entertainment, usefulness or simply for pure innovation. Well, that’s not it. With new technology like Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication, Self-driving vehicles with the help of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), Energy storing body panels, Augmented Reality Dashboards, and much more, the idea of a conventional automobile’s idea is being replaced. The day isn’t far when Stark’s tech won’t be just on the movie screen!\n\n Coming to the growth of EV (Electric vehicles). Experts are of the opinion that the EV share of the total vehicle sales will ramp up gradually as costs fall and charging infrastructure improves, but this trend won’t be starting to shake up the industry until beyond 2020. Overall, we expect the path of travel to have a cumulative, rather than a sudden impact.\nWe see semiconductor and software providers as primary beneficiaries of the rising digital content in vehicles, although automakers and part suppliers are working aggressively to catch up. Adapting to rapid technology changes while keeping prices competitive poses major challenges for both the traditional vehicle industry and technology sector newcomers.\nBut, how smooth will the transition from IC Engine cars to EV be? Various factors like electricity availability, economic factors, Lithium-ion battery recycling and so on are very crucial factors to be considered. Developed countries and industry giants like the US, Germany may find the transition easier. But, for the rest 80% of the world, these factors are a major issue.\n**So, finally…**\n\n\n![petrol.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1619868241/petrol_68c3167c2d.png)\n\n> “Change is the only constant”\n\n\nWell, the automotive industry isn’t an exception. The progression of developments is an exponential one. But, the ultimate goal of all these developments still remains the same- customer satisfaction. Even though the use of newer technology and fuel against conventional cars is a debatable one, the practice of making automobiles better than the previous one will always prevail.\n\nP.S: I really hope that there will be flying cars in the 22nd century ;)","date":"December 8th, 2020","displayOnBlog":true,"excerpt":"Imagination is certainly a gift to humankind.
