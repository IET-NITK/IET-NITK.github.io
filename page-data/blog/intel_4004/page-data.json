So, lets look at the microprocessor that started it all the Intel 4004.  \n\nEarly computers (2nd gen) used transistors from as early as 1940s, but the drawbacks  \nwere it took up a large amount of space, and required a cooling system and were costly  \nand not versatile. By the end of the 60s engineers found a way to combine multiple  \ntransistor into a single IC. Although this reduced the size of the computers compared to  \nthe earlier ones. They still needed numerous chips to function.  \n\nThe use of MOS(metal-oxide semiconductor) ICs in computers paved the way for the first  \nmicroprocessor. At first the MOS transistors were slower and unreliable compared to their  \nbi-polar counterparts. Hence they were used to design computers only when performance  \nwas not the top priority. The first computer designed using the MOS technology was the  \n24-bit general-purpose computer D2000 used for aviation and navigation. It was very  \ncompatible , and was used for guidance on the Poseidon submarine-launched missile.  \n\nIn the late 1960s a Massachusetts-based start-up called Viatron Computer  \nSystems announced its System 21, a 16-bit minicomputer built from MOS chips. The  \nSystem 21 was aimed, among others, at applications such as mathematical and statistical  \nanalysis, business data processing, data entry and media conversion, and  \neducational/classroom use. Viatron introduced the term \"microprocessor\" in 1968,  \nalthough they were referring to their 2101 terminal and not a chip as we know it. It was a  \nterminal which was made of 18 MOS chips on three separate boards.  \n\nIn 1971, BusiCom, a Japanese calculator maker partnered with Intel, an American  \nsemiconductor company to design a multi-chip calculator. The 4004, created by Federico  \nFaggin who led the project from its beginning to completion. Marcian Hoff formulated and  \nled the architectural proposal in 1969, and Masatoshi Shima contributed to the architecture  \nand later to the logic design. The end result was a 4-bit wide single chip CPU and the first  \nmicro-processor Intel 4004. The BusiCom calculator 141-PF came out soon after. The Intel  \n4004 microprocessor was also used in the first microprocessor-controlled pinball game, a  \nprototype produced by Dave Nutting Associates for Bally in 1974.  \n\n![intel 4004.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1638450438/intel_4004_020a077d10.jpg)\n\n\nThe 4004 marked the start of the dominance of Intel in the semiconductor industry and\nwas the most advanced IC in its time.\n\n• Features of the Intel 4004\n \n           o Maximum clock rate : 740 kHz.\n           o Instruction cycle time : minimum 10.8 μs.\n           o Instruction execution time : 1 or 2 machine cycles (10.8 or 21.6 μs), 46250 to 92500 instructions per second.\n           o Transistors : 2300\n           o Core count : 1\n           o Separate program and data storage.\n           o Can directly address 640 bytes of RAM.\n           o Can directly address 32,768 bits of ROM.\n           o Instruction set contains 46 instructions.\n           o Register set contains 16 registers of 4 bits each.\n           o Internal subroutine stack, 3 levels deep.\n           o Circuit line width : 10microns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","date":"December 2nd, 2021","displayOnBlog":true,"excerpt":"An Overview of World's First Microprocessor - INTEL 4004","title":"THE FIRST MICROPROCESSOR(INTEL 4004)"},"before":{"nodes":[{"route":"zero-day-vln","title":"What is a zero-day vulnerability?","date":"September 29th, 2021","excerpt":"An interesting dive into the what's, when's and how's of Zero Day Vulnerabilities","authors":[{"name":"Shreya Chandra"}]}]},"after":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"INTEL_4004","sig":null,"date":"2021-12-02"}},
