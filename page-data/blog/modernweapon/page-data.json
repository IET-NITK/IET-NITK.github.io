But things have changed in the 21st century. What do you think is the best weapon in the 21st century? It's the brain, not money, not power. Why am I saying this? First, even strong organizations crumble with time but the intellectual property doesn't.\n\nThe highly experienced and talented brain can understand things easily and can work through challenging situations easily with no sweat. Now, what do I mean by \"talented brain\"? A brain that can imagine and comprehend things very fast. Through a topic in whatever book, it can see the efficient way to learn and comprehend it. People need to train their brains in that way.\n\n\n\n\n![brain.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1621771337/brain_8fb268f5e7.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology changes through time, people and organizations that can adapt will survive through the changes. If people have a highly talented brain that can adapt quickly, naturally they don't get fazed by technological changes.\n\n\n ![bird.jpeg](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1621764789/bird_ddbd274911.jpg)\n\nI have seen a tv series in which all the people on the planet earth get petrified for some unknown reason and the only way to undo the petrification is nitric acid. Some people came out of the petrification only to find that 3000 years passed away. The protagonist revives the long-lost modern civilization from the ground up through his knowledge of cars, engines, bulbs before petrification i.e. 3000 years ago and beats the crap out of the antagonist who has nothing but a strong body going on for him.\n\nI never said that having a strong body is a waste, it's just that priorities are changed. In the warring period, indeed brains that can come up with strategies to subdue the enemies are valuable but muscles to execute the tedious strategies are even more valuable. Now the situation changed that's all.\n\nThis is based on the theory that people can train their brains just like the body. So, let's look at some analogous things between brain training and body training. The body strengthens according to the training regimen so does the brain when trained in a certain way. The body becomes flabby without training and the brain loses its sharpness if not used for a long time. Some people have body well-conditioned and is in perfect shape even when they don't do any exercise just like how smart people score good marks even when they study less time.\n\nSo, let's discuss the technique to train the brain. I think the most effective way to remember things is to imagine while reading just like how you imagine scenery and background music while reading a novel and combine these imagined pictures so that the whole picture makes a lot more sense than it did before. Subjects or courses become complicated in university so students naturally don't imagine while reading which will affect their understanding of the subject. But once you imagine and understand the subject it becomes a lot easier.\n\nWith this, I conclude that people should train their brains to live better in the 21st century.\n\n**\"YOUR MIND IS  YOUR GREATEST POWER.
