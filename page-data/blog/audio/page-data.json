Before the computer era, the medium for audio recording was a large mixing console directly synched to the tape\n\nEven now, this primitive way of recording Is used.  But, the mixing, mastering, even sometimes, recording is done on computers using Softwares known as Digital Audio Workstations(DAWs).\n\n![Showing the DAW Ableton live 9 on My Laptop. Arrangement for recording a song](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1619870655/2_1cf523ff94.png)\n\n\nSo, You can release a song at home by pushing some buttons. Simple isn’t it?\n\n**NO!!**\n\nThe Entire process of releasing an audio track involves not just recording, But mixing as well as Mastering. Everyone can record. But people don’t spend years on learning the art of sound engineering if it wasn’t for these two processes.\n\n**Mixing**\n\nAfter recording a track, it is very essential to manipulate the track to satisfy the mood of the song. This involves :\n- Adjusting the balance between various frequency components in that audio. The process is known as Equalizing.\n- Reducing the volume of loud sounds and amplifying quiet sounds, thus Compressing the signal’s dynamic range. This process is called Compression.\n- Oscillating the audio between the left and right audio channels according to the need. This process is called Panning.\n- Spacial effects like Reverb, Decay, Chorus, etc are added.\n- The DAWs allow Frequency shift, also known as autotune, used extensively by vocalists nowadays :P\n    \nThere are many more processes like phasing, resonating, saturating, etc. beyond my present scope of knowledge\n\nMastering\nThis is a Post-production process which involves transferring the final audio into various formats like cassette tapes, CDs, Vinyl, and digital Mp3 format.\n\n\n\n","date":"December 22nd, 2020","displayOnBlog":true,"excerpt":"How is music produced?","title":"Audio Production"},"before":{"nodes":[{"route":"internet-owns","title":"Who Owns the Internet","date":"December 16th, 2020","excerpt":"Ever thought how internet comes to you?
