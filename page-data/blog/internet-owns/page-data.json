Consider a Youtube video which comes from a server in California, USA. Your internet provider may not have a reach till that server. So what is the procedure? How does the internet actually come to you? Here, a very important role is played by fiber optic cables which are placed inside oceans connecting many continents. This is actually how you get an access to the internet.\n\n![AT&T is one of several companies that own part of the Internet backbone](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1620479419/image002_dfd54b0def.jpg)\n\n**AT&T is one of several companies that own part of the Internet backbone**\n\n\nWho laid these cables there? There are certain companies who have invested their money in these underwater cables. Corporations such as Global Cloud Xchange has FLAG(Fibre-Optic Link Around the Globe), which is 28,000 km long fiber optic that connects UK, Japan, India, and many places in between. Its Europe-Asia segment was the fourth longest cable in the world in 2008. The physical network that carries Internet traffic between different computer systems is the Internet backbone. In the early days of the Internet, ARPANET served as the system’s backbone. Today, several large corporations provide the routers and cables that make up the Internet backbone. These companies are upstream Internet Service Providers (ISPs). That means that anyone who wants to access the Internet must ultimately work with these companies, which include:\n\n-  UUNET\n-   Level 3\n-  Verizon\n-  AT&T\n-  Qwest\n-  Sprint\n-  IBM\n\n![internet.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1619868134/internet_ad9f478a5e.png)\n\nISP’s are classified at three different levels. Type one includes the actual investors who invest in under ocean cables. These owners need not pay anyone; ISP’s under these owners pay them. Level2 has national level companies like Airtel, BSNL, etc who have access throughout the country. These are the companies who pay the type1 companies. And there are level3 type companies which provide a network to certain limited areas only; for example, Act Fibernet in Bengaluru and Hyderabad. These type3 companies set up towers and provide a network with a fixed set of connections and bandwidth (up to 100 connections). This is how your payment goes from type3 to type1 companies.\n\n![https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KH0E0WcxIag/XBZeRcvFRnI/AAAAAAAAAC4/S8vVOWbGmUMgXGKCzAoaC0XGr1qYFezvgCLcBGAs/s320/image008.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1620479806/image008_75d134f65d.jpg)\n\nThe individual computer networks that make up the Internet can have owners. Every ISP has its own network. Several nations' governments oversee computer networks. Many companies have local area networks (LANs) that link to the Internet. Each of these networks is both a part of the Internet and its own separate entity. Depending on local laws, the owners of these networks can control the level of access users have to the Internet.\n\n![https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J32vw_dfeX8/XBZeO0-CutI/AAAAAAAAAC0/3RLcczgJLfcN26e1FtsFmjDRetDMF_bVgCLcBGAs/s320/image005.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1620479806/image005_778b69174b.png)\n\nYou might consider yourself to be an owner of the Internet. Do you own a device that you use to connect to the Internet? If so, that means the device you own becomes part of the enormous inter-networked system. You are the proud owner of part of the Internet -- it's just a very small part.","date":"December 16th, 2020","displayOnBlog":true,"excerpt":"Ever thought how internet comes to you?
