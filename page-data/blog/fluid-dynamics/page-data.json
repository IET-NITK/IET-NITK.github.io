Being the young and curious man that I am, I was indeed fascinated by those wavy patterns trailing behind the boat and would try to run my hands over it. I am definite that, majority of you are a proof of my testimony, while observing a raft of ducks paddle through the ponds. Well, today we shall delve into these patterns, called the Kelvin Wakes and investigate the science behind them.\n\nA majority of you are familiar with the basis of nomenclature for a number of natural phenomena as they are predominantly named after its founding scientist. In our scenario, the name Kelvin Wakes is attributed to the physicist Lord Kelvin, who contributed his fair share of research on these intriguing patterns. \n\nDid you know? If a certain water body is deep enough as compared to the length of generated waves, the angle at which the wake fans are generated is essentially the same regardless of the source producing the wake. This wondrous observation was only made factual, with Lord Kelvin’s experimental procedures. \n\nLet us explore the science behind these feathery ripple waves to a greater extent. We are all aware of the fact that the speed of light or sound has a constant speed in a specific medium. Since our context deals with water waves, the phenomenon of ‘Dispersion’ comes into picture. Dispersion is an occurrence where waves of different wavelengths travel at different speeds, and this proves to be a vital characteristic of water waves.\n\nConsidering water waves of a particular wavelength, consequently, these waves possess a particular speed. If the water waves moves faster than the boat, we observe a series of circular water waves with the wakes being absent. If the waves are slower than the boat, the circular waves cumulate to form a ‘V-shaped wake’ known as a Mach Cone. The significance of the speed of the boat is paramount, slower the boat speed, narrower is the V-shape.\n\n ![1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1620905032/1_e1296e731d.png)\n\nSimilar to other waves, water waves constantly repeat themselves, often in resonance. Hence, each wave is a series of circular waves. Inevitably, instead of one V-shaped wave, the moving boat generates a series of these peculiar patterns with these V-shaped waves each one wavelength apart.\n\n ![2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1620905170/2_160481e475.png)\n\n\nIf you observe these waves, it is more than definite that the V-shaped arrangement we witness is not that of a straight line as depicted above. In reality, a boat or a duck makes waves of different wavelengths. \n\nIn our situation, we considered wake formation from waves optimally formed of the same wavelength. The V-shaped wakes formed of a larger wavelength are farther apart and broader with the distance between them being equal to that of the wavelength. Contrarily, those formed with a smaller wavelength are closer and are narrower. \n\nTaking into account the aspects that we discussed and portraying it over a range of wavelengths, VOILA! We obtain an eminent set of wakes, utilizing specific angles and the phenomenon of dispersion, as shown below.\n\n![3.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1620905294/3_5f220bb44f.png)\n\nSo next time when you are cruising on a boat with your family or friends, just boss around explaining the ‘deep’ science behind the wakes!!\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://fyfluiddynamics.com/2021/04/kelvin-wakes/\n\nhttps://youtu.be/95sQcSulRFM\n\nhttps://www.itp.uni-hannover.de/fileadmin/itp/emeritus/zawischa/static_html/KWake.html","date":"April 1st, 2021","displayOnBlog":false,"excerpt":"Explore the science behind the flow patterns observed while trailing a boat.","title":"The Enchanted Realm of Fluid Dynamics"},"before":{"nodes":[{"route":"flying-cars","title":"All About Flying Cars","date":"March 9th, 2021","excerpt":"Have you ever been stuck in heavy traffic or unlucky enough to encounter every Red...","authors":[{"name":"M Poojitha"}]}]},"after":{"nodes":[{"route":"virtual-reality","title":"An Era of Virtual Reality","date":"May 19th, 2021","excerpt":"A look through how technology has progressed with VR","authors":[{"name":"Krishna Poojitha Vantakula"}]}]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"Fluid-dynamics","sig":null,"date":"2021-04-01"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1681770253","3346060996","940918685"]}
