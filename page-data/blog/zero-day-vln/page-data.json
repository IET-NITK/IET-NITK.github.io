A security breach will have a profound effect on our lives in this computer-generated era.  Vulnerabilities are unintended flaws found in software programs or operating systems. Risk is the result of improper computer repair or security and configuration errors. If left unchecked, vulnerability creates security holes that cyber criminals can exploit.\n\n#### What is a zero day vulnerability?\n“Zero-day” is a newly discovered software vulnerability. Because the developer has just learned of the flaw, it also means an official patch or update to fix the issue hasn’t been released. Term “zero-day” refers to the fact that the developers have zero days to fix the problem that has just been exposed . Once the vulnerability becomes publicly known, the vendor has to work quickly to fix the issue to protect its users.But the software vendor may fail to release a patch before hackers manage to exploit the security hole. That’s known as a zero-day attack. An exploit that attacks a zero-day vulnerability is called a zero-day exploit.\n \nThe risk of zero days poses a significant risk to users for the following reasons:\n- Cybercriminals rush to exploit these vulnerabilities to get money from their programs\n- Vulnerable systems are exposed until a patch is issued by the vendor.\n\n##### Recent zero day attacks and exploits\n- May 10, 2021 - Remote Mouse mobile app contains  raft of zero-day RCE vulnerabilities.\n- May 4, 2021 -Pulse Connect Secure zero-day stars in critical patch batch\n- April 21, 2021-Zero-day vulnerabilities in SonicWall email client led to network access, backdoors installed\n- April 15, 2021 -Behind the Great Firewall: Chinese cyber-espionage adapts to post-Covid world with stealthier attacks\n- April 9, 2021- Zero-click Zoom exploit among winners as payout record smashed\n \n##### What can you do to help protect yourself from the dangers of zero days?\nZero-day vulnerabilities present serious security risks, leaving you susceptible to zero-day attacks, which can result in potential damage to your computer or personal data.\nTo keep your computer and data safe, it’s advisable to take proactive and reactive security measures\nYour first line of defense is to be proactive. Proactive cyber security involves identifying and addressing security risks before an attack. It is done using a wide range of security software, which protects against both known and unknown threats.\nYour second line of defense is to be reactive and immediately install new software updates as soon as they are available from the manufacturer to help reduce the risk of malware infection. Software updates allow you to install the required updates to the software or operating system. This may include installing new features, removing obsolete features, updating drivers, delivering bug fixes, and most importantly, repairing defective holes.\nFollow these steps to keep information safe from security risks:\n- Keep software and security updates up to date by downloading the latest software releases and updates. Installing security patches fixes bugs that the previous version may have missed.\n- Establish safe and effective personal security practices online.\n- Configure security settings for your app, Internet browser, and security software.\n- Install effective and comprehensive security software to help prevent known and unknown threats.\n","date":"September 29th, 2021","displayOnBlog":true,"excerpt":"An interesting dive into the what's, when's and how's of Zero Day Vulnerabilities","title":"What is a zero-day vulnerability?"},"before":{"nodes":[{"route":"ietnitk_intro","title":"What We Do","date":"September 25th, 2021","excerpt":"An introduction to all SIGs in IET NITK","authors":[{"name":"Vishwa Mohan Tiwari"},{"name":"Laksh Sadhwani"}]}]},"after":{"nodes":[{"route":"INTEL_4004","title":"The First Microprocessor: Intel 4004","date":"December 6th, 2021","excerpt":"An Overview of World's First Microprocessor - INTEL 4004","authors":[{"name":"M Poojitha"}]}]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"zero-day-vln","sig":null,"date":"2021-09-29"}},
