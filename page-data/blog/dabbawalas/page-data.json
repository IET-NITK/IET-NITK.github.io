Recognized with Six Sigma level of accuracy, their model has earned them\nadmirers from Britain’s Prince Charles to entrepreneur Richard Branson.\n\nNearly 5,000 men mainly depend on suburban trains to deliver home-cooked food in more than two\nlakh dabbas every day. The services which started 125 years ago, is now a ₹40-45-crore industry with an\naverage monthly fee of ₹450 per box. Their whole process is linked closely to Mumbai’s railway system.\n\nMight sound surprising but a good reason for their success is very less reliance on technology and\nutmost dependence on human capital.\n\n![WhatsApp Image 2022-01-31 at 2.56.34 PM.jpeg](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1648563851/Whats_App_Image_2022_01_31_at_2_56_34_PM_c773973375.jpg)\n\n\n**Business aspect:**\n\nA 2010 study by the Harvard Business School graded it “Six Sigma”, which means the dabbawalas make\nfewer than 3.4 mistakes per million transactions. With deliveries to and from roughly 200,000 customers\neach day that translates to little more than 400 delayed or missing dabbas in a year.\n\nDabbawalas claim a six-sigma accuracy level, which means only one mistake is made every 16 million\ndeliveries. Mumbai dabbawalas are already being used as a case study, given their near-perfect\nmanagerial operations.\n\n **Trivia:**\n\n- Relying on their efficient and full-proof logistic system, Flipkart recently decided to partner with the\nMumbai Dabbawalas to navigate the city streets.\n\n- They have had loyal (or should that be royal) admirers in the likes of Prince Charles (as per the folklore:\nof the four people from India invited to his wedding, two were dabbawalas ).\n\n- They have had a documentary made on their work by the Carnegie Mellon Professor Paul Goodman\nbesides of course the famous HBR article.\n\n**Scope of Management:**\n\nVery less dependence on technology, which may lead to their downfall in the future generations.","date":"March 30th, 2022","displayOnBlog":true,"excerpt":"125 years old system that feeds Mumbai","title":"Mumbai Dabbawalas"},"before":{"nodes":[{"route":"Metaverse","title":"Entry to the Metaverse: A Virtual World","date":"March 13th, 2022","excerpt":"Entry to the Metaverse: A Virtual World","authors":[{"name":"Vighnesh Kothalikar"},{"name":"Vaishnavi Prakash Kalgutkar"}]}]},"after":{"nodes":[{"route":"Razor-Blade","title":"Razor and Blade Business Model","date":"July 19th, 2022","excerpt":"Razor and Blade Business Model","authors":[{"name":"Nithin L N"},{"name":"Aditya Sanjiv Joshi"}]}]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"Dabbawalas","sig":null,"date":"2022-03-30"}},
