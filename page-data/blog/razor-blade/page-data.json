This revolutionized the shaving industry. The razors were\nsold at a low price, making them popular, but only the blades produced by him would fit\nthem. He made a fortune by selling patented razor blades.\n\nToday, the net worth of Gillette is approximately 7.55 billion U.S. dollars!!\nThe razor blade business model involves selling a product at a lower price, then selling\na related product later for a profit.\n\nGillette is one of those few companies that has been in the market for more than 100\nyears surviving seven revolutions and two world wars! In the late 19th century, there\nwere only two kinds of razor blades used, viz., Straight razor and safety razor. The\nStraight razors were considered too risky because they were super sharp. The safety\nrazor was like a one-time purchase, but once you bought it you had to frequently keep\nsharpening it.\n\nTo reduce the prices and to make shaving affordable for everyone, a traveling\nsalesman named King Camp Gillette came up with the idea of detachable disposable\nblades with a single razor. This became a huge hit in the early 1900s, and Gillette became\nthe market leader for about 15 years, but the sales were down by 20% in just one year\nonce the patent ended in 1921.\n\n![king-camp-gillette-17203de7-30f4-4cbc-aba7-9581d15f83b-resize-750.webp](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1657302294/king_camp_gillette_17203de7_30f4_4cbc_aba7_9581d15f83b_resize_750_521fa4c0d3.webp)\n\n\nThis is when the revolutionary idea of the razor blade model came into existence.\nGillette sold the razors at an ultra-low price and sometimes even at a loss while capping\nthe price of blades at a higher margin. Once the customer buys razors from Gillette, the\ncustomer has entered the \"Gillette's Ecosystem\" and there is no going back. So the\ncustomer keeps buying the blades we can have a recurring profit from each customer.\nAfter 1922 when the razor blade strategy was fully implemented, the sales of Gillette\nrazors skyrocketed by a humongous 127%.\n\nThe product(razor) is appealing as it is sold at a low price. It then implicitly forces the\ncustomers to buy related products (blades) ensuring study revenue. It also creates\ncustomer loyalty as the customer gets used to the current product and may think twice\nto switch to a different company and there are also potential high psychological\nswitching costs. By developing and providing various kinds of related products(blades)\nthe company gives customers freedom and flexibility to choose from a wide variety of\nproducts.\n\nAside from razor blades themselves, there are many other brands in different industries\nutilizing this business model. Gaming industries extensively use razor and blade\nbusiness model. Sony uses its pricing model and sells its PlayStation consoles at a\nloss, just so that they can make recurring profits through CDs and PlayStation Plus\nsubscriptions. Microsoft makes no money on the sale of its Xbox One X game console\n\neven at an average $499 price, but it gets about $7 out of each $60 video game. Keurig\nsells a range of single-serve coffee makers, with some available for less than $100,\nwhere it makes money in the sale of coffee pods, with a 6-pack alone retailing for\naround $20. Amazon Kindle today is being sold at almost 0 profit just so that Amazon\ncan make billions out of its e-book sales.\n\nLike every strategy, even this 'almost best' strategy has its own drawbacks. The biggest\nthreat to the razor and blades business model is competition. Other companies may\nattempt to maintain their consumable monopoly (and maintain their margin) by\npreventing competitors from selling products that match with their durable goods. For\nexample, computer printer manufacturers will make it difficult to use third-party ink\ncartridges, and razor manufacturers will prevent cheaper generic blade refills from\nmating with their razors. If a competitor offers a comparable consumable product at a\nlower price, the sales of the original company's product suffer, and their margin erodes.\nBrands that implement the razor-blade model always run the risk that they will not\nrecoup their initial costs. If the business is heavily subsidizing the initial product, poor\nsales in the premium product may result in an overall loss.\n\nBusinesses need to understand that this model is a double edge sword because if they\nare too dependent on this strategy, they might end up like Kodak. They were so stuck in\nmaking money by selling their film rolls that despite being one of the first companies to\nfile a patent for digital cameras, they did not realize that the film roll itself will cease to\nexist with the rise of the digital revolution. From being the leader of cameras to\ndisappearing from the market itself just because of depending too much on this model.\n\nNevertheless, this model yields maximum user retention. If this method is implemented\ncorrectly with a well-planned pricing strategy taking into account all other confounders\nand factors, ensuring flexibility and customer loyalty, it can do wonders. This is a proven\nfact, and this is how the Razor Blade strategy is being used by the top industries like\nApple, Sony, Amazon, One-Plus, etc. and has become the billion-dollar strategy.","date":"July 19th, 2022","displayOnBlog":true,"excerpt":"Razor and Blade Business Model","title":"Razor and Blade Business Model"},"before":{"nodes":[{"route":"Aerodynamics","title":"Insane Engineering of SR71","date":"July 13th, 2022","excerpt":"Interesting facts and engineering behind the designing of SR71, aka, Blackbird","authors":[{"name":"Rohit Behera"}]}]},"after":{"nodes":[{"route":"space","title":"Warp drive: key to faster than light travel ","date":"August 2nd, 2022","excerpt":"Human's Curiosity and Exploration","authors":[{"name":"Amrith Raj"}]}]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"Razor-Blade","sig":null,"date":"2022-07-19"}},
