We are one of the five other SIGs that form the exclusive club group in IET NITK.\n\nWe'll be using this article to explain how IET NITK works and what are the parts of our club: we'd explain our each of our SIGs work. Also make sure that you read on till they end: we have some tips and suggestions for you on how to deal with the recruitment season as well.\n\n![Our seniors from Batch of 2020 and 2021](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1632545049/3_75e5379a55.jpg)\n\n*Our seniors from Batch of 2020 and 2021*\n\n![4.jpeg](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1632545049/4_7a19914dd5.jpg)\n\n*This is a shot from our interview with Pratyush Giri, SCP 2018*\n\n- -----\n### Cipher\n![1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1632545050/1_da5fe85e64.png)\n\n*That's our 2019 convenor Bhargav and 2020 convenor Skanda showcasing their Cipher project.*\n\nWe are the **Computer Science** SIG of IET NITK. Here is where you can pursue your interest in anything and everything that has a computer (and some coffee?) involved in it: from competitive programming to machine learning and from blockchain to web and mobile development. \n\nWe also have a strong presence on our IET NITK Discord channel, where we encourage people with different tastes in computer science to hang out and share resources on what they like or what they wish to learn.\n\nSome of our highlight projects are: Virtual TryOn (trying on fashion virtually via AR),  Experiencing Homes in VR (Checking out homes and apartments virtually) & Face to Emoji (an ML model to convert a portrait to an emoji). None of these projects were conceived overnight: we consider and evaluate our projects each year after thorough discussions and requirements analysis.\n\nWe love to conduct events as well: we find that there is a huge trove of topics in Computer Science that we can geek about, so we encourage all our members to hold KEPs to enlighten the audience. Despite the online semester, we've held some of our highlight events like Brute Force Made Easy (our annual CP contest),  CommitCon (Git and Open Source Festival) and Innerve (IET NITK's annual showcase). And this year, we have an even bigger agenda on the events side: to bring in professionals and alumni to enlighten us about their particular fields.\n\nDon't be under the impression that all we do is host public events and do projects! We also hold weekly CP preparation contests for our members before summer vacations for internship and placement season as well. And we're definitely not \"all work and no play\" either: we regularly hold SIG-wide game contests to engage all the members too.\n\n\n#### Recruitment Process\nThe first step, as always, is to fill the main IET NITK recruitment form from [here](iet.nitk.ac.in/recruitment/form). With that done, following is the process:\n- An online test to evaluate your knowledge on C programming ,Basic C concepts and Aptitude.\n- An interview for us to know more about you: how you are, and how you would approach a   problem in the CS/IT field.\n- An HR interview to know what you’re looking for and what you can offer to IET NITK and Cipher in general.\n\nPlease find out more at iet.nitk.ac.in/sigs/cipher\n\n-----\n### Rovisp\n\n![2.jpeg](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1632545049/2_2571692d3c.jpg)\n\n*Likitha at Project Expo*\n\nRovisp SIG is a group of IET people interested in electronics, communication, ML and signal processing.

These multi concept projects didn't happen overnight. They were taken right from the scratch with group discussions, weekly meetings and requirements such as study materials, tutorials were provided along with one on one interaction sessions at all times. \n\nKeeping the projects on one hand, Torsion has never failed to enlighten its other aspiring junior core engineers with various mind blowing concepts in their field via various events. Despite the online semester we could successfully pull off events like **Torsion sculpt, Talk on research internships and MS Abroad, Webinars on different softwares like blender, CFD, MATLAB, AutoCAD** bringing in our alumni from various parts of the world. We give a clear picture on what you guys can do at the present to mold your future in your field of interest.\n\nAfter all this if you are still figuring out your interests, no worries because Torsion got it's series of KEPs on some really important softwares from both engineering and career point of view.
