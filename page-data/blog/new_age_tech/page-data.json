Artificial intelligence basically means intelligence of machines. The ability of computer systems or machines to operate and process data like a human being is called Artificial Intelligence. Personal assistant like Apple iPhone's Siri , Google Assistant , Alexa are creation of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing many areas like education and finance. In the future AI will bring more smarter and efficient machines to make our lives easier and better. Autonomous vehicles will be on the road very soon, a lot of research and development is going in that field. Amazon is working on faster delivery through drones with the help of AI which can respond to human gestures as well. Dominos is also working on an autonomous vehicle for fast pizza delivery which can take orders from the customers directly. AI will surely make some jobs obsolete: eminent scientist Stephen Hawking warned us that artificial intelligence could lead to the end of human race. Elon Musk , CEO of SpaceX also fears that artificial intelligence could be our biggest threat.\n \n \nArtificial intelligence has shown great significance in material science in recent years only strengthens the idea. Accurate predictions of phase diagrams, crystal structure and material properties are some domains of material science where there has been a significant application of AI in the recent times. A combination of experiments and computer simulations has contributed towards exploring materials design more economically.  The introduction of various computational methods in materials science, such as the density functional theory (DFT), Monte Carlo simulations, and molecular dynamics, enabled researchers to explore the phase and composition space more efficiently than ever.\n\nExperts also believe that AI in the future will also be able to make human life much easier by providing solutions to almost all challenges. AI has a great importance in healthcare. Different companies are trying to develop different quick diagnosis technologies with the help of AI. In the business sector, AI can save a lot of time and effort. Robotic Automation can be used to complete business task. In various other fields as well, the contribution of AI is huge. Hence it is clear that AI is all set to be the future of the entire world. \n\n","date":"September 5th, 2021","displayOnBlog":true,"excerpt":"Artificial Intelligence: an overview on how is it now and where do we see it in the future","title":"Artificial Intelligence: The Way Forward"},"before":{"nodes":[{"route":"ModernWeapon","title":"21st Century's Weapon","date":"May 24th, 2021","excerpt":"What do you think is the best weapon in the 21st century?
