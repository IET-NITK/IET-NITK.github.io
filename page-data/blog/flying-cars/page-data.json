I’m certain flying cars will exist in the future !!\n\nA flying car was once thought to be possible in the movies, however, the world is closer than ever to experiencing this mind-blogging phenomenon.\n\nScientists and Engineers we have today are no less than wizards and superheroes in the supernatural world. They can make nearly anything possible.\n\nThere are hurdles obviously but a lot of research and development is going on to make “Flying cars” possible in the near future\n\n![002_2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1619799735/002_2_3b3c3d670c.png)\n\n\nIt has been a life-long dream of young and old dreamers, since at least the 1950s. **Drive your vehicle out of the garage at home, go to the nearest airport, unfold its wings, and FLY! **\n\n***Intriguing right?***\n\n***Let’s dive into the world of flying cars:***\n\nFlying cars are far smaller than a plane, most are designed with rotors like drones instead of wings, which allow vertical takeoff and landing. Tilt rotors allow great efficiency in forward flight at longer distances, while multi-rotors are designed to reduce noise in hover flight.\n\nDreams about flying cars started long ago in the early 19’s. lets see the early developments of flying cars\n\n***History:***\n\n1917- Glenn Curtiss build the first known prototype of a flying car\n\nIn 1936: Henry Ford developed **“sky flivver”.**The project was abandoned due to a pilot death because of a flight crash\n\nIn 1940: Henry Ford predicted: “Mark my word: a combination airplane and motorcar is coming. You may smile, but it will come.”\n\nIn 1946:The Fulton FA-2 Airphibian, American-made roadable aircraft. Four prototypes were built although it was not a commercial success\n\nIn 1947, Henry Dreyfuss developed the ConvAirCar, which was an automobile with wings and a propeller on the roof. The vehicle was made of fiberglass. However, it crashed during a test flight, resulting in a fatal accident.\n\nIn 1949: The [Aerocar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerocar), designed and built by Molt Taylor, made a successful flight.  In total, six Aerocars were built.  despite wide publicity and an improved version produced in 1989, Taylor did not succeed in getting the flying car into production.\n\nIn the early 50s, Leland Bryan flew his Autoplane but ended up dying while crashing another version of it two decades later.\n\n1973: Another tragic flying car death occurred in 1973 when Henry Smolinski crashed in a test flight. His creation paired a Ford Pinto with a Cessna Skymaster\n\n, And few others\n\nBy the 21st century, many companies are involved in developing electric flying cars. Some of them are uber,cartivitor, kitty hawk corporation, E-Volo, Airbus, EHang, etc.\n\nFew successful developments are:\n\n1. PAL-V Liberty\n2. Aeromobil\n2. Terrafugia Transition\n2. Terrafugia-TF-X etc…\n\nPAL-V Liberty :\n\nThe Personal Air and Land Vehicle(PAL-V) is an aircraft manufacturer based in Netherlands.\n\nThe company has been in business for more than 20 years with the dream of building an actual flying car from the get-go.\n\nAfter years of research and development, it launched its first flying car known as PAL-V Liberty.\n\nThe PAL-V Liberty is the world’s first production legal flying car on sale\n\nAfter being the first flying car to get road permission for Europe, PAL-V is now also the first to complete the full certification basis with EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency)\n\n“The PAL-V flying car, having two engines, can run at a speed of 160 kilometers on road and can fly at a speed of 180 km. The car can turn into a flying vehicle in just three minutes and cover a distance of 500 km on a full tank.”\n\n![003_3.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1619799735/003_3_a31c191363.png)\n\n\nThis is soon going to be a reality, even in India!\nAs per a statement released by the company, the government would assist PAL-V to obtain all the necessary approvals that will be required to set up the manufacturing facility in Gujarat. \nAeroMobil:\n\nSlovakia-based AeroMobil remains committed to releasing a functioning flying car it calls “a supercar with superpowers.”\n\nIt’s on its fourth prototype, so you know it’s not joking\n\nThe latest version of AeroMobil has undergone over 10,000 hours of simulated and live flight tests throughout its development.\n\nAeroMobil claims the test flights were successful and vehicles will be available in 2023 that can fly at 160 miles per hour.\n\nAeroMobil 3.0\n\n\n![004_4.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1619799735/004_4_cebd3bbc61.png)\n\n\nTerrafugia Transition:\n\nBy April 2014, 12 two-person test flights had taken place; this was the first time that anyone other than Terrafugia’s chief test pilot had flown the Transition\n\nIn January 2021, Terrafugia announced that the Transition received a Special Light-Sport Aircraft (LSA) airworthiness certificate from the FAA for the Transition to be flown only, with road use approval to follow in 2022.\n\nSo that’s one step to becoming a flying car.\n\n***\n\n![005_5.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/iet-nitk/image/upload/v1619799735/005_5_cb19d7785d.png)\n\n\nSo what are your opinions about flying cars now?\n\nThey are cool right!!\n\nObviously, but what do u think about their safety? Their cost-efficiency?\n\nso if we look deep beyond the advantages we are having, we surely have some challenges to face.\n\nCreating a flying vehicle that’s safe for users poses numerous engineering challenges.\n\nFew challenges are:\n\n***Weight:***\n\nAircraft MUST be light to fly. Cars need to be strong to pass mandatory crash tests. Those requirements are contradictory. Most proposals end up as an awkward hybrid.\n\n***Cost:***\n\nNo Doubt, too expensive. Even a flying taxi also costs much higher than a normal taxis. Maybe mass production and high usage electric flying cars and developments,poosibly soon can make us take a ride\n\n***Safety:***\n\nFlying cars pose serious safety issues. A car that malfunctions fifty feet up in the sky, the danger is magnified many times over.\n\nWhat if a flying car malfunction or run out of fuel or battery in the middle of a busy city and falls down on a crowd of people?\n\n***Energy consumption:***\n\nThey consume a lot of energy so need to have a better battery or fuel backup to avoid fatal accidents\n\nHope these challenges and issues are addressed and solved with future technological advancements and one day we can take a ride in flying cars just like we have dreamt.But it will be no longer be a fantasy or dream sure they will take quite a long time and effort because even the great ***“Rome wasn’t built in a day!!\"***\n\nIn the meantime, most of us will be driving on the ground.","date":"March 9th, 2021","displayOnBlog":true,"excerpt":"Have you ever been stuck in heavy traffic or unlucky enough to encounter every Red...","title":"All About Flying Cars"},"before":{"nodes":[{"route":"slow-texting","title":"The Art of Slow Texting","date":"February 28th, 2021","excerpt":"A few weeks ago, I was texting my friend, who would take hours to respond ...","authors":[{"name":"V Madhan Kumar"}]}]},"after":{"nodes":[{"route":"virtual-reality","title":"An Era of Virtual Reality","date":"May 19th, 2021","excerpt":"A look through how technology has progressed with VR","authors":[{"name":"Krishna Poojitha Vantakula"}]}]}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"flying-cars","sig":null,"date":"2021-03-09"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1681770253","3346060996","940918685"]}
