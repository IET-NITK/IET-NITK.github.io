Upon further analysis, stents were found to be the best solution to this problem and hence, a structural analysis of stent during its insertion into the artery was conducted using ANSYS.","sig":"Torsion","label":"Expo 2021"},{"title":"Rice Transporting Machine","builtBy":["Shilpashree Venkatesh","Naveen Patidar","Nitish Kumar Kattimani"],"description":"Optimization of hand picking mechanism in rice Transplanter","sig":"Torsion","label":"Expo 2021"},{"title":"Thermal Analysis of Disc Brakes","builtBy":["D Raghavi"],"description":null,"sig":"Torsion","label":"Expo 2021"},{"title":"CFD Analysis of Dimpled Wing of an Aircraft","builtBy":["Sudheer Kumar Verma","Shreyas S Deshpande"],"description":"The main objective of aircraft aerodynamics is to enhance the aerodynamic characteristics and maneuverability of the aircraft. This enhancement includes the reduction in drag and stall phenomenon. The dimpled airfoil has comparatively lesser drag as compared to plain airfoil. Introducing dimples on the aircraft wing will create turbulence by creating vortices which delays the boundary layer separation resulting in decrease of pressure drag and also increase in the angle of stall. In addition, wake reduction leads to reduction in acoustic emission. The objective is to improve the aircraft maneuverability by delaying the flow separation point at stall and thereby reducing the drag by applying the dimple effect over the aircraft wing. A computational analysis has done to know the dimple effect on aircraft wing","sig":"Torsion","label":"Expo 2021"},{"title":"FEA and CFD Analysis of Wind Turbine Blade","builtBy":["Harhikrishnan S","S Sriram"],"description":null,"sig":"Torsion","label":"Expo 2021"},{"title":"Experiencing Homes in VR","builtBy":["Rhevanth M","Yashwanth Reddy","Gaurav Chaurasia","Marmik Mundada","Sachin Pandey","Sowmya G","Krishna Poojitha Vantakula"],"description":"Walkaround and interact with objects and customize a home in virtual reality","sig":"Cipher","label":"Expo 2021"},{"title":"Tic-Tac-Toe AI Player","builtBy":["Nirmal Khedkar","Feyaz Baker"],"description":null,"sig":"Cipher","label":null},{"title":"Virtual Try-On","builtBy":["M.T.Aakash Chandra","Amal Majunu Vidya","V Madhan Kumar","Dhruv Agja"],"description":null,"sig":"Cipher","label":"Expo 2021"},{"title":"Smart Aid for Blind","builtBy":["Pratigya Ranjan","Ravi Gocher","Jagan Mohan"],"description":null,"sig":"Rovisp","label":null},{"title":"Eastern western note classifier","builtBy":["Sharuf Baig"],"description":"We were able to analyze a simple series of musical sounds and determine each of their respective note simultaneously..","sig":"Rovisp","label":null},{"title":"Street Light Glow","builtBy":["Rameshwar Dhakad","Venkat Rohit Merugu","Sharuf Baig"],"description":"Street lights along highways during night time will be only ON when they detect vehicles on road,otherwise off.","sig":"Rovisp","label":"Expo 2021"},{"title":"Mini Jarvis","builtBy":["Nithin L N","Saurabh Gole","Ram Janam Yadav"],"description":"Home automation demo using a Google voice assistant applet.","sig":"Rovisp","label":"Expo 2021"},{"title":"Programmable DC Load","builtBy":["Abhishek C Hiremath","Surag P","M Poojitha"],"description":"A programmable DC load is a test equipment for batteries which emulates the DC resistance load.","sig":"Rovisp","label":"Expo 2021"},{"title":"MHD Propelled Boat","builtBy":["Vishwa Mohan Tiwari","Gopal Nath Reddy"],"description":"Plasma Physics is not only applicable to earths core and the sun but did you ever wonder that it can propel a boat as a clear energy source of energy.
