Think of the product and the first thing that will come to your mind will surely be this brand! Can such a brand enter another industry sector and fare well in it? Or would it be disastrous? We deal with this question and the challenges that come along with it. Taking the example of the unsuccessful venture of Colgate-Palmolive, popularly known as Colgate, into the frozen-food industry, we look at what went wrong and what could be done differently if we were to give it another shot in the present times. We attempt to relaunch the product in the current market scenario. We look at the Indian frozen-food industry and analyse the same to devise a strategy wherein Colgate-Palmolive could run a successful business in the industry. ","sig":{"name":"Venture"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"Naveen Patidar"}]},{"title":"Work Management System","project_report":null,"description":"A task management application developed for managing various tasks happening within IET NITK.
