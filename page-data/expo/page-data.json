Using CFD analysis, the phenomena of blood flow through a artery was done and recirculation of blood was found. Upon further analysis, stents were found to be the best solution to this problem and hence, a structural analysis of stent during its insertion into the artery was conducted using ANSYS.","sig":"Torsion","builtBy":["Nikitha Garapati","Abin Sibichan"],"url":null},{"title":"CFD Analysis of Dimpled Wing of an Aircraft","description":"The main objective of aircraft aerodynamics is to enhance the aerodynamic characteristics and maneuverability of the aircraft. This enhancement includes the reduction in drag and stall phenomenon. The dimpled airfoil has comparatively lesser drag as compared to plain airfoil. Introducing dimples on the aircraft wing will create turbulence by creating vortices which delays the boundary layer separation resulting in decrease of pressure drag and also increase in the angle of stall. In addition, wake reduction leads to reduction in acoustic emission. The objective is to improve the aircraft maneuverability by delaying the flow separation point at stall and thereby reducing the drag by applying the dimple effect over the aircraft wing. A computational analysis has done to know the dimple effect on aircraft wing","sig":"Torsion","builtBy":["Sudheer Kumar Verma","Shreyas S Deshpande"],"url":null},{"title":"Chatbot","description":"A real time chat bot is developed to answer queries related to IET.","sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Krishna Poojitha Vantakula","Indhu Lekha","Atul Kumar"],"url":null},{"title":"Experiencing Homes in VR","description":"Walkaround and interact with objects and customize a home in virtual reality","sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Rhevanth M","Yashwanth Reddy","Gaurav Chaurasia","Marmik Mundada","Sachin Pandey","Sowmya G","Krishna Poojitha Vantakula"],"url":null},{"title":"FEA and CFD Analysis of Wind Turbine Blade","description":null,"sig":"Torsion","builtBy":["Harhikrishnan S","S Sriram"],"url":null},{"title":"Face Mask Detector","description":null,"sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Maheshwari Mihir Premjibhai","Aniket Srivastava"],"url":"https://github.com/Mihir3101/IETC-2020-Face-Mask"},{"title":"Face to Emoji","description":"An emotion classifier that uses Resnet model it predicts 7 different emotions and according to that displays the appropriate emoji","sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Sharuf Baig","Diksha Negi","Adith Shekhar Gatty","Akash Kumar Varanasi"],"url":"https://github.com/DikshaNegi13/face-to-emoji"},{"title":"Gender Identification from Speech","description":"Building a model to identify whether given speech is uttered by male or female","sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Venkat Rohit Merugu","Govardhan"],"url":"https://github.com/venkatrohit219/gender-detection-from-speech"},{"title":"Jigsaw Puzzle Solver","description":null,"sig":"Torsion","builtBy":["Rohit Behera","Diksha Negi"],"url":null},{"title":"MHD Propelled Boat","description":"Plasma Physics is not only applicable to earths core and the sun but did you ever wonder that it can propel a boat as a clear energy source of energy. Here we worked on an MHD (Magnetohydrodynamics) boat. An innovation for the future. The basic equations of plasma physics are analysed . Complex CFD simulations alongside a prototype is proposed for MHD boats.","sig":"Torsion","builtBy":["Vishwa Mohan Tiwari","Gopinath Reddy"],"url":null},{"title":"Mini Jarvis","description":"Home automation demo using a Google voice assistant applet.","sig":"Rovisp","builtBy":["Nithin L N","Saurabh Gole","Ram Janam Yadav"],"url":null},{"title":"Music Generation using Deep Learning","description":"Generating music using deep learning architectures such as RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) and GANs (Generative adversial networks) that have been trained on datasets containing traditional songs.","sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Skanda Upadhyaya","Aprameya Dash","Mohammed Ibrahim","Laksh Sadhwani"],"url":"https://github.com/IET-NITK/Music-Generation-DL"},{"title":"OCR for Handwritten Text","description":"An API powered by a neural network model trained to recognize handwritten text from images","sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Nirmal Khedkar","Jayesh Kumar Soni","K Snehith Bhagavan","Uday Kumar"],"url":"https://github.com/nirmalhk7/HandwritingRecognizer"},{"title":"Programmable DC Load","description":"A programmable DC load is a test equipment for batteries which emulates the DC resistance load.","sig":"Rovisp","builtBy":["Abhishek C Hiremath","Surag P","M Poojitha"],"url":null},{"title":"Rice Transporting Machine","description":"Optimization of hand picking mechanism in rice Transplanter","sig":"Torsion","builtBy":["Shilpashree Venkatesh","Naveen Patidar","Nitish Kumar Kattimani"],"url":null},{"title":"SC Voting App","description":"Web application for Students' Council Election.This web application let's the voting mechanism of the current student council election to go entirely online.","sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Tarun S Anur","Sahana","Suhas Gopinath"],"url":null},{"title":"Street Light Glow","description":"Street lights along highways during night time will be only ON when they detect vehicles on road,otherwise off.","sig":"Rovisp","builtBy":["Rameshwar Dhakad","Venkat Rohit Merugu","Sharuf Baig"],"url":null},{"title":"Thermal Analysis of Disc Brakes","description":null,"sig":"Torsion","builtBy":["D Raghavi"],"url":null},{"title":"Virtual Try-On","description":null,"sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["M.T.Aakash Chandra","Amal Majunu Vidya","V Madhan Kumar","Dhruv Agja"],"url":"https://github.com/aakashabhi/Virtual-Try-On"},{"title":"Web Security and User Tracking","description":null,"sig":"Cipher","builtBy":["Varsha P","Rajan Jaiswal","Satyam Jyotsana Gargee"],"url":"https://github.com/rj-since-2000/IETC-2020"}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3346060996","3818438335","3886595457"]}
