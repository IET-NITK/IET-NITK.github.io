During this process heat is generated which may lead to failure and damage of the disc brake. In this project, we have tried to design two different models of disc brake based on the literature available. Then the steady state thermal analysis was carried out using Ansys. From this we can get to know about the heat dissipation in the two disc brakes and can come to a conclusion about which one is better.","sig":{"name":"Torsion"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"D Raghavi"}]},{"title":"Sudoku Solver","description":null,"sig":{"name":"Cipher"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"Verupaka Yashwanth Reddy"},{"name":"Adith Shekhar Gatty"}]},{"title":"Street Light Glow","description":"Street lights along highways during night time will be only ON when they detect vehicles on road,otherwise off.","sig":{"name":"Rovisp"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"Venkat Rohit Merugu"},{"name":"Rameshwar Dhakad"},{"name":"Sharuf Baig"}]},{"title":"Stock Trading Bot","description":null,"sig":{"name":"Venture"},"url":null,"authors":[]},{"title":"Stick Pick","description":null,"sig":{"name":"Rovisp"},"url":null,"authors":[]},{"title":"Smart Car Parking System","description":"Parking Slots booking with Smartphones.

This enhancement includes the reduction in drag and stall phenomenon. The dimpled airfoil has comparatively lesser drag as compared to plain airfoil. Introducing dimples on the aircraft wing will create turbulence by creating vortices which delays the boundary layer separation resulting in decrease of pressure drag and also increase in the angle of stall. In addition, wake reduction leads to reduction in acoustic emission. The objective is to improve the aircraft maneuverability by delaying the flow separation point at stall and thereby reducing the drag by applying the dimple effect over the aircraft wing. A computational analysis has done to know the dimple effect on aircraft wing","sig":{"name":"Torsion"},"url":null,"authors":[{"name":"Sudheer Kumar Verma"},{"name":"Shreyas S Deshpande"}]},{"title":"Business Models Case Study","description":null,"sig":{"name":"Venture"},"url":null,"authors":[]},{"title":"Blood Flow through stents in Artery","description":"The study mainly focuses on CFD analysis of blood flow through stents, placed in an artery.
