  description: The study mainly focuses on CFD analysis of blood flow through stents, placed in an artery. Using CFD analysis, the phenomena of blood flow through a artery was done and recirculation of blood was found. Upon further analysis, stents were found to be the best solution to this problem and hence, a structural analysis of stent during its insertion into the artery was conducted using ANSYS.

  sig: Torsion
  label: Expo 2021
  description: "The main objective of aircraft aerodynamics is to enhance the aerodynamic characteristics and maneuverability of the aircraft. This enhancement includes the reduction in drag and stall phenomenon. The dimpled
  airfoil has comparatively lesser drag as compared to plain airfoil. Introducing dimples on the aircraft wing will create turbulence by creating vortices which delays the boundary layer separation resulting in decrease of pressure drag and also increase in the angle of stall. In addition, wake reduction leads to reduction in acoustic emission. The objective is to improve the aircraft maneuverability by delaying the flow separation point at stall and thereby reducing the drag by applying the dimple effect over the aircraft wing. A computational analysis has done to know the dimple effect on aircraft wing"
