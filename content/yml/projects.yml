    The study mainly focuses on CFD analysis of blood flow through stents,
    placed in an artery. Using CFD analysis, the phenomena of blood flow through
    a artery was done and recirculation of blood was found. Upon further
    analysis, stents were found to be the best solution to this problem and
    hence, a structural analysis of stent during its insertion into the artery
    was conducted using ANSYS.

    Disc brake is used to reduce the speed or stop the motion of the vehicle. During this process heat is generated which may lead to failure and damage of the disc brake. In this project, we have tried to design two different models of disc brake based on the literature available. Then the steady state thermal analysis was carried out using Ansys. From this we can get to know about the heat dissipation in the two disc brakes and can come to a conclusion about which one is better.

    The main objective of aircraft aerodynamics is to enhance the aerodynamic
    characteristics and maneuverability of the aircraft. This enhancement
    includes the reduction in drag and stall phenomenon. The dimpled airfoil has
    comparatively lesser drag as compared to plain airfoil. Introducing dimples
    on the aircraft wing will create turbulence by creating vortices which
    delays the boundary layer separation resulting in decrease of pressure drag
    and also increase in the angle of stall. In addition, wake reduction leads
    to reduction in acoustic emission. The objective is to improve the aircraft
    maneuverability by delaying the flow separation point at stall and thereby
    reducing the drag by applying the dimple effect over the aircraft wing. A
    computational analysis has done to know the dimple effect on aircraft wing

    Wind blades play a significant role in determining a wind turbine's efficiency. Although the theoretical maximum efficiency a wind turbine can achieve is 59% with proper designing of airfoils and blades, we can obtain efficiency close to 59 percent. This project mainly focuses on analyzing a real-life engineering problem on stresses and deformations caused by aerodynamic forces acting on a wind turbine's blades by performing CFD and FEA analysis.

With the help of velocity contour, pressure contour and turbulent kinetic energy contour we will analyse 2D airfoil. Here we have taken all data in standard form as given by NASA for example rynolds number, viscosity cooficient, density and angle of attack for airfoil.
