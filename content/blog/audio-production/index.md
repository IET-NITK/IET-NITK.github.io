How is music produced?

When I first listened to music, the question came to my mind:

“How is the entire arrangement recorded and produced, whereas when we try on our audio recorders, we get a heavily distorted, and low
quality audio?”.

Well here’s the answer: All the instruments and vocals are either recorded individually through Highly precise, unidirectional microphones to avoid feedback from the output, or for some specific effects, sounds are programmed on MiDi using a Keyboard synthesizer.
Before the computer era, the medium for audio recording was a large mixing console directly synched to the tape
