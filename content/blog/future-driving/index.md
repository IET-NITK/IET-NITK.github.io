From someone who is a motorsports enthusiast, an enviromentalist and not a petrol-head.


I'm not a petrol-head in particular: I dont awe at v8 v12 engines at high rev's. I dont have a driving license. I dont have a favorite car in particular. I'm not in any field related to cars either: I'm into Computer Science. I identify myself as an environmentalist: not a full-on Greta Thunberg, but nevertheless.

Check out this interview by [John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/21/success/waymo-ceo-driverless-cars/index.html), Google's autonomous car division. He puts it really nicely:

> "You ask a room full of people: 'Do you love to drive?' and most people actually would raise their hand," ... "But if we ask the question a slightly different way, 'Do you love commuting? Do you love driving on your commute?' I think most people would say. 'Eh, not so much.'"

And he goes on to explain the logic behind a petrol-head like him running an autonomous car company. But I come out with a different conclusion: clearly the industry has made its mind and declared electric cars/Hydrogen cars as the future. But isn't that something for commuters and not for petrolheads? 



Where are the cars for the car-lovers?

Why is the car industry, when making electric cars, focusing on people who simply commute with their cars, but not on the petrol-head?
