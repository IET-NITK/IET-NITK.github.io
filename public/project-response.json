In this project we use hashing,a process in which reproducible hash tokens are extracted to save the effort, this method compares the hash values instead of the whole ﬁles so that it will be more efficient, Audio fingerprinting is the process of representing an audio signal in a compact way by extracting relevant features of the audio content.The fingerprints from the unknown sample are matched against a large set of fingerprints stored in the database. In this our model we are using mysql as the database.Companies like shazam, phillips, intrasonics and many more use audio fingerprinting for various implementations.\r\n\r\n## AUDIO RECOGNITION\r\nRead the audio file recorded and store it into a 2-D array of amplitude against time.The recording can be done using the microphone or the input file can be read from the system itself and saved as an audio file.This process is same for both , adding the audio files to the database as well as for recognising the audio files i.e both training and testing phase.\r\n\r\n![audio](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/1_smebNTc.max-800x600.png)\r\n\r\n## Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\r\nNow we use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to change the waveform to frequency domain from time domain.\r\n\r\n![audio](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/2_aRt4ylH.max-800x600.png)\r\n\r\n## Spectrogram\r\nNext step is to perform Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT) of the audio signal by breaking down the signal into small chunks and performing the Fourier Transform on each of them to generate the spectrogram, which is a visual plot of all three variables amplitude against time and frequency.\r\n\r\n![audio](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/3_sZdzF6w.max-800x600.png)\r\n\r\n## Mapping peaks\r\nThe processing is usually carried out on a 2-D array , which stores the STFT coefficients of the file and the peaks, local maxima points of the file, which are mapped by masking.A set of the peak and its neighbour are passed to a hash function to generate a hash. A hash is an encoded string which is unique for each input. An audio fingerprint is generated which is a set of hash values and the offset value(time component of the peak).This value is stored in the database with a unique song_id. After we perform these steps on the known file we can match the audio file.\r\n\r\n## Recognise the song\r\nWe recognise the song by comparing the hash value from the database.A pair of key-value is appended into an empty dictionary created for each song. Where key is the difference between the database offset and the sample offset and value if the number of repetitions of the matches we get while comparing the hash values. A score is calculated for each song which is the maximum value of ‘value’ in that particular dictionary. The song with maximum score is the best match for the input file and the model returns the song name with the score value.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nThe model has been successful in recognizing the song by finding the fingerprints. The further improvements for this model would be to use noise filter techniques, get accurate fingerprints and improve the database.\r\n\r\n## RESOURCES\r\n- [medium article on audio fingerprinting](https://medium.com/swlh/understanding-audio-fingerprinting-b39682aa3b5f)\r\n- [ourcodeworld.com/shazamclone](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/973/creating-your-own-shazam-identify-songs-with-python-through-audio-fingerprinting-in-ubuntu-18-04)"

So if the Equation is 15a=45, then user need to write 15a-45 and then upload it on the website.\r\n- The user uploads an image to the website as shown below:-\r\n![eq](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161968276-040dad35-b81d-4a47-b595-f428496ff800.jpeg)\r\n- Then the image is processed and converted to desired image that model wants as shown below.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161968517-78d5adaf-96bc-472b-a5c2-7dbab94c7bdf.png)\r\n- Model then detect that an equation with **variable 'a'** has been uploaded & generates the following output.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161969317-027e503f-a9a7-45b4-b077-d06458b8e9b0.png)\r\n- Similarly for **Linear Equation in two variable** user need to upload two Images as shown below:-\r\n![eq1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161969873-2dd69652-67b2-4930-9de3-c97184875e3c.jpeg)\r\n![eq2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161969912-505cc709-95ba-492b-bfd7-dcce54944027.jpeg)\r\n- Again Model coverts both images as desired images & Solves it!!\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161970223-07b7aaa5-ef10-49d9-b28e-d6ff49df8766.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161970272-64c63894-d011-4e15-9264-5f33c4609531.png)\r\n- **Model produces Following output:-**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161970375-8d5d9888-e699-4a15-819d-52a759ddd2cc.png)\r\n\r\n## Why CNN?\r\n- In traditional Neural Networks, one need to specify the important features to be considered while **CNN** automatically detects the important features without any **Human Supervision.**\r\n- Our project involved **high level pixel processing** and CNN's are considered to be the best for that as it can learn the key features for any class itself.\r\n- **CNN's** even have better accuracy than any other **Machine Learning Model** when it comes to **\"Detection\"**.Hence CNN was the best thing to be used for this project.\r\n\r\n## Challenges We ran into\r\n- When we trained the CNN Model for **\"=\"** , **\"(\"** & **\")\"** signs, its accuracy reduced significantly which is absurd.\r\n- Introducing variable **\"x\"** was challenging as **\"x\"** also represents multiplication sign. So we introduced **\"a\"** & **\"b\"** as variables.\r\n- User is constrained to write the equation in a paper with white unruled background. Ruled background confuses the CNN Model & it produces unusual results.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Test Backend\r\n- Download the **.ipynb** file from the github & upload it in **Google Colab**.\r\n- Also Do upload the **model** folder in the colab environment.\r\n- Now you may upload your own custom equations in the Colab environment & all other steps are mentioned in the .ipynb file itself.\r\n> Do Ensure that you crop the equation to the maximum extent.\r\n> Do this!!!👇👇👇\r\n\r\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161974694-5f5fb2a0-1244-47f1-b9c5-3164d41d216c.jpeg)\r\n> Not this!!!👇👇👇\r\n\r\n![eq7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85332648/161974775-dd58c278-7488-45ca-b272-f08e15a5ce46.jpeg)"

      "project_body": "# Sudoku Solver\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nSudoku is a logic-based puzzle where the user is given a 9 x 9 grid, which consists of nine 3 x 3 sub-grids, and the objective of the puzzle is to fill these sub-grids with numbers from 1 to 9 such that no two numbers appear in the same row, same column and the same sub-grid of the 9 x 9 grid. Initially, the grid is partially filled with digits in specific locations to make sure the puzzle is well-posed and has a single solution. This is a very popular puzzle that has been featured in newspapers since the 19th century, the first being featured in a French newspaper. The puzzle can range in difficulty from easy to hard and is also quite addictive. There are many people who start off their typical day by reading the newspaper in the morning and solving puzzles like Sudoku. The Sudoku solver application aids the users to obtain a solution of a sudoku puzzle by providing an incomplete sudoku puzzle as the input. The further sections will cover the functionality and the working of the Sudoku solver application.\r\n\r\n## Functionality of the Application\r\nThe Sudoku solver application takes the incomplete Sudoku as the input and, if valid, solves the Sudoku and displays it; otherwise displays the error message indicating invalid input.\r\nThe application enables the user to provide input in two ways:\r\n\r\n- **Camera/Photo upload:** User has the option to click or the upload the photo of the sudoku as the input\r\n- **Manual input:** User needs to manually enter the numbers in the corresponding boxes as the input. If the given input is solvable or valid and the application solves and displays the complete sudoku. Otherwise it will give out a message indicating that the sudoku was invalid i.e there was no solution possible in such a way that it follows all the rules of a classic sudoku puzzle.\r\n\r\n## Working of the Application\r\nThe basic user interface of the application was developed using Flutter, which is a software development kit created by Google and uses the Dart programming language to develop applications. This app consists of 2 tabs and the user between these tabs (by default the first tab remains activated) by clicking the respective button in the bottom navigation bar. The two tabs are:\r\n\r\n1. **Scan/Upload tab:**\r\nThis tab enables the user to provide an input via an image. They need to click the camera icon to take a photo and click the image icon to upload a photo. Once the required photo is clicked or uploaded, they are given an option to crop the image and they must crop out only the sudoku puzzle out of that image(Important). The cropped out sudoku puzzle is then displayed on the screen. This feature of providing an image as the input by taking a picture or uploading an image and then cropping out the image was made possible by using the **document_scanner_flutter 0.2.5 **dart package. The user must click the ‘OK’ button below the displayed image to start the text scanning process. For this functionality **google_ml_vision 0.0.7 **dart package was used which returned all the scanned text and its corresponding bounding box (coordinates of the box around the text in pixels) from the image. With this, their respective index is calculated and filled in the 9 x 9 matrix. After the scanning process the application directs the user to the second tab.\r\n2. **Fill tab:**\r\nThis tab initially displays an empty sudoku i.e 9 x 9 boxes or cells with no values. The user has the option to enter a value in the cell by clicking the particular cell (which highlights the cell) and then clicking the button with their required number. There are also options to clear a selected cell or reset the whole sudoku. Note: Changes in the sudoku cause the corresponding changes in the 9 x 9 matrix that was initially declared as a zero 9 x 9 matrix (where 0 indicates no value at that particular position). If the user has given the input through 1st Tab, they are directed to the second tab and the corresponding changes in the 9 x 9 matrix is reflected in the displayed sudoku. The user can make some changes to make sure it matches the input sudoku in case of some errors. Note: The result from scanning isn’t always accurate and might miss some numbers or display wrong numbers in the wrong position. Finally the user must click the submit button which sends the 9 x 9 matrix to a function to implement the sudoku solving algorithm.\r\n\r\n**Sudoku solving algorithm:**\r\nThe main algorithm used in the process is **Backtracking**. we have made some sub functions inside the code to solve the different part of algorithm for sudoku solver including :\r\n\r\n**IsValid():** This function is basically made for checking the validity of a particular number in a specific index of 9 X 9 grid for correct sudoku. It takes input as grid, number, rowindex, columnindex and gives boolean validation.\r\n\r\n**SolveSudoku():** This function is basically made for solving 9 X 9 grid into correct sudoku. It terminates when the index reaches the end of the grid and also handles the boundary conditions.\r\nThe final output will depend on the return statement where true will display the matrix in the form of sudoku and false will display a message indicating invalid input.\r\n\r\n## Dart packages used in the application:\r\n\r\n- [google_ml_vision(v0.0.7)](https://pub.dev/packages/google_ml_vision)\r\n- [document_scanner_flutter(v0.2.5)](https://pub.dev/packages/document_scanner)"

      "project_body": "# Image-Based-Gaming\r\n\r\n## Aim\r\nThe primary objective of this project is to develop a real-time gesture-controlled keyboard simulator. By leveraging computer vision techniques, we aim to create an intuitive interface that allows users to control basic keyboard functions through hand gestures captured by a webcam.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nGesture control has emerged as an exciting frontier in human-computer interaction, offering a natural and intuitive means of communication with digital systems. In this project, we harness the power of computer vision to detect and interpret hand gestures in real-time. These gestures are then translated into corresponding keyboard inputs, enabling users to interact with applications without physical input devices.\r\n\r\n## Methodology\r\nThe methodology employed in this project encompasses several key steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Real-time Video Capture**:\r\n   - Initialize a video capture object using OpenCV (`cv2.VideoCapture(0)`). This object captures frames from the webcam in real-time.\r\n\r\n2. **GUI Initialization**:\r\n   - Create a named window using OpenCV (`cv2.namedWindow('Result')`) to display the processed output.\r\n   - Create trackbars to allow interactive adjustment of HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) values used for color segmentation.\r\n\r\n3. **Gesture Detection**:\r\n   - Read each frame from the webcam (`cap.read()`), resize it, and flip it horizontally (`cv2.flip(frame, 1)`).\r\n   - Define a region of interest (ROI) within the frame, typically encompassing the area where hand gestures will be performed.\r\n   - Convert the color space of the ROI from BGR to HSV (`cv2.cvtColor(roi, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)`).\r\n\r\n4. **Color Segmentation**:\r\n   - Apply Gaussian blur (`cv2.GaussianBlur`) to reduce noise in the image.\r\n   - Define lower and upper thresholds to create a binary mask (`cv2.inRange`) isolating the desired color (usually skin tones representing the hand).\r\n\r\n5. **Contour Detection**:\r\n   - Apply morphological operations (`cv2.morphologyEx`), such as opening, to the mask to remove small noise and smooth the edges.\r\n   - Detect contours (`cv2.findContours`) within the binary mask, representing the boundaries of objects.\r\n   - Select the largest contour, typically representing the hand, based on its area (`max(contours, key=lambda x: cv2.contourArea(x))`).\r\n\r\n6. **Convex Hull and Extreme Points**:\r\n   - Compute the convex hull of the hand contour (`cv2.convexHull`) to obtain a polygon that encloses the hand region.\r\n   - Identify extreme points of the convex hull, such as the top, bottom, left, and right points, to calculate the center and other parameters.\r\n\r\n7. **Gesture Analysis**:\r\n   - Compute Euclidean distances between key points, such as fingertips and palm center (`pairwise.euclidean_distances`), to analyze gestures.\r\n   - Calculate slopes between specific points to determine hand orientation or gesture direction.\r\n\r\n8. **Keyboard Simulation**:\r\n   - Based on the analyzed gestures, simulate predefined keyboard commands (e.g., W, A, S, D) using the `Control` class (`control.py`).\r\n   - The `Control` class interprets hand gestures and triggers corresponding keyboard commands using the `directkeys.py` module.\r\n\r\n9. **Interactive Control**:\r\n   - Continuously check for user interactions, such as adjusting HSV values through trackbars or activating gesture control with a start button.\r\n   - Upon detecting gestures and analyzing them, simulate keyboard inputs accordingly, allowing users to control applications or games.\r\n\r\n10. **Display and User Feedback**:\r\n    - Display the processed output, including the hand ROI, detected contours, and simulated keyboard inputs, in real-time using OpenCV.\r\n    - Print relevant information, such as Euclidean distances and slopes, to the console for debugging or user feedback purposes.\r\n\r\n11. **Termination**:\r\n    - Continue the main loop until the user presses the 'Esc' key (`k == 27`), at which point release the video capture object and destroy OpenCV windows.\r\n\r\nBy following this methodology, the code achieves real-time gesture-controlled keyboard simulation, providing users with an intuitive and interactive means of interfacing with digital systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nThe implementation of the gesture-controlled keyboard simulator consists of three primary components:\r\n\r\n1. **final.py**: The main script responsible for capturing webcam input, processing hand gestures, and simulating keyboard inputs based on the detected gestures.\r\n2. **control.py**: A module containing the Control class, which interprets hand gestures and triggers appropriate keyboard commands.\r\n3. **directkeys.py**: A utility module providing functions to simulate keyboard key presses and releases using low-level system calls.\r\n\r\n### Libraries used:\r\n•\tpython 3.x\r\n•\timutils\r\n•\tnumpy\r\n•\topencv2\r\n•\ttime\r\n•\tsklearn\r\n•\tctypes\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to run the code:\r\n1.\tDownload the zip file and unzip all in same folder. We have used PyCharm Community Edition to run the codes. You may use other python editors which support the above libraries.\r\n2.\tRun the final.py file.\r\n3.\tAdjust the HSV values using the track bar, so that only your hand is visible.\r\n4.\tAfter that, set the Start track bar to 1. \r\n\r\nYou can now use your hand to control the game. \r\n\r\n### Note: \r\n1.\tPlease use plain white or black background for more accuracy. Also, make sure the room is well lit.\r\n2.\tYou are free to modify the slope and distance values depending upon the gesture you make in control.py.\r\n3.\tYou can map more gestures with keys. Refer to: https://gist.github.com/dretax/fe37b8baf55bc30e9d63\r\n\r\n## Results\r\nThrough rigorous testing and experimentation, we have achieved promising results with our gesture-controlled keyboard simulator. Users can effectively control basic keyboard functions using intuitive hand gestures, providing a seamless and engaging interaction experience.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/Cborgg/IET-Project---Image-Based-Gaming/assets/118260187/a0ed582f-11a0-4d9b-bb29-ea52829746cc)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nGesture control represents a compelling approach to human-computer interaction, offering benefits such as natural interaction, accessibility, and hands-free operation. While our project focuses on a basic implementation of gesture-controlled keyboard input, the underlying principles can be extended and adapted for various applications, including gaming, accessibility tools, and interactive interfaces.\r\n\r\n## References\r\nFor further exploration and understanding of the technologies and methodologies employed in this project, we recommend the following resources:\r\n\r\n- [OpenCV Documentation](https://opencv.org/)\r\n- [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/)\r\n- [scikit-learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html)\r\n- [Code to interact with the keyboard keys](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14489013/simulate-python-keypresses-for-controlling-a-game%20#%20http://www.gamespp.com/directx/directInputKeyboardScanCodes.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Mentors and Mentees\r\nMentees:\r\nGautam Sivakumar\r\nAbhijeet Adi\r\nAkash Reddy"

      "project_description": "The main idea behind our project is to upscale images using Machine Learning Algorithms. We chose two specific features, the resolution of the image and the brightness that can be enhanced using these algorithms. Super resolution model uses supervised learning to learn how to increase the resolution of the image and successful applies it on the images provided. The brightness enhancement is applied only when a pre-defined function evaluates the image and concludes that it is needed, this is to prevent transforming images into those that have intense glares coming from light sources. This particular phase is applied using an unsupervised model called Zero-DCE. The two models are integrated and deployed using streamlit platform.",

      "project_body": "# Image Super Resolution\r\n## Motivation for the Project\r\nThis is a project done under IET NITK where the goal is to enhance the brightness of low light image and then pass it to the super resolution model to enhance the visibility and clarity of the image and removing the noise such that the output image is much more clear and visibily pleasing and aesthetically appealing.\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOur proposed model begins by implementing a mechanism to determine whether the input image exhibits characteristics of low-light conditions.Causes of low-light conditions can be due to insufficient or\r\nabsent light source or uneven illumination caused by back-light and shadows. Subsequently, we will develop a function capable of discerning whether the given image meets the criteria for low-light classification. Upon identification of a low-light image, we will employ the Zero DCE model to enhance its brightness.\r\n\r\nFollowing the enhancement process through the Zero DCE model, the image will undergo further refinement using the Super Resolution model. This subsequent step aims to produce a substantially clearer and denoised version of the image, leveraging the sophisticated capabilities inherent to the Super Resolution model.\r\n\r\nIn essence, our model is designed to automatically detect and address low-light scenarios in images, enhance their brightness using Zero DCE, and further refine them to achieve superior clarity and noise reduction through the Super Resolution model. This holistic approach ensures that images exhibiting low-light conditions are effectively processed to yield optimal visual outcomes.\r\n#### Working\r\n\r\nThe Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation (Zero DCE) model is a state-of-the-art method in the field of image enhancement, particularly in addressing low-light conditions. Unlike traditional methods that rely on reference images or prior knowledge, the Zero DCE model operates without any reference input, hence the term \"zero-reference.\"\r\n\r\nAt its core, the Zero DCE model utilizes deep neural networks to predict a transformation curve that can effectively enhance the brightness and visibility of low-light images. This transformation curve is learned directly from the input low-light image itself, without the need for additional reference images or external information.\r\n\r\nThe key innovation of the Zero DCE model lies in its ability to capture and exploit the inherent characteristics of low-light images to generate accurate and effective enhancement curves. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model can adaptively adjust the brightness levels of pixels in the input image, effectively amplifying details and enhancing visibility without introducing excessive noise or artifacts.\r\n\r\nThe Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SR-GAN) represents a cutting-edge approach to image enhancement, specifically targeted at increasing the resolution and fidelity of low-resolution images. Leveraging the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), SR-GAN operates on the principle of adversarial training, where two neural networks, namely the generator and the discriminator, engage in a competitive learning process to produce high-quality, high-resolution images.\r\n\r\nThe generator network within SR-GAN is tasked with learning a mapping function that takes a low-resolution image as input and generates a corresponding high-resolution output. Through an iterative process, the generator learns to upscale the image while preserving important details and features. Concurrently, the discriminator network is trained to distinguish between real high-resolution images and those generated by the generator. This adversarial setup encourages the generator to produce increasingly realistic and visually pleasing results.\r\n\r\nOne of the key strengths of SR-GAN lies in its ability to generate photo-realistic images with enhanced resolution, surpassing the capabilities of traditional interpolation-based methods. By harnessing the power of GANs, SR-GAN is able to produce sharp, detailed, and visually appealing images that closely resemble their high-resolution counterparts.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n[link text](https://li-chongyi.github.io/Proj_Zero-DCE.html)\r\n\r\n[link with title](https://pyimagesearch.com/2022/06/06/super-resolution-generative-adversarial-networks-srgan/)"
